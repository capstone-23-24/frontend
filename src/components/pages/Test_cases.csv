(DTBC) the Chinese heavy-duty segment of multinational automobile manufacturer Daimler AG (Daimler) found himself sitting in a police station in Beijing China. The police officers had taken him in for questioning after a heated quarrel in a parking lot where he allegedly lost his temper over a parking space. GÃ¤rtner and a Chinese driver were both trying to park their cars at the same time in the same space. This resulted in GÃ¤rtner screaming racially loaded insults. Onlookers tried to intervene and GÃ¤rtner used pepper spray. One bystander got injured and had to be treated in the hospital for eye injuries. How did it all happen? How did a seemingly small frustration get out of control and turn into such an ugly story? What on earth had happened to GÃ¤rtner? Chinese social media soon connected this incident with Daimlerâ€™s corporate culture and asked people to boycott Mercedes cars. The story went viral and was picked up by mainstream news outlets around the world. Against general upward market trends Daimlerâ€™s share price weakened. What options did Daimler have to remedy the situation?GÃ¤rtnerâ€™s BackgroundUntil that Sunday morning in November 2016 everything was going perfectly fine for GÃ¤rtner. His career was on a smooth and rather steep trajectory; his life was full of achievements. He received his Master of Business Administration degree with a focus on exports sales and marketing from the Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich (Germany) followed by a Doctor of Philosophy degree in economics from the same university in 1997. Besides his native German he spoke English Spanish and Turkish. GÃ¤rtnerâ€™s employer Daimlerâ€™s business unit Mercedes-Benz Cars in Germany entrusted him with increasing responsibilities. From 2004 to 2010 he was a senior manager with the Mercedes-Benz Guard division. In this role he was responsible for product management and worldwide sales marketing and service operations for armoured cars at headquarters in Stuttgart Germany. In 2010 GÃ¤rtner was sent on an expatriate assignment to South Korea. Daimler was paying great attention to the fast-growing Korean market which reached a whopping growth in new imported car registrations of 25.5 per cent over the previous year. Moreover 71 per cent of foreign cars sold in South Korea that year came from Germany. GÃ¤rtnerâ€™s initial position in South Korea was head of sales and marketing Daimler Trucks Korea Ltd. from which he soon made it to vice-president of commercial vehicle sales. In 2013 he was invited into a high-potential program with sessions on leadership and self-development at the International Institute for Management Development (IMD). The next promotion came in December 2013 all the way up to the position of CEO of Daimler Trucks Korea Ltd. In this role he had full profit and loss responsibility for new vehicle sales (trucks buses and vans) and after-sales (parts and accessories). He was further responsible for managing the supply chain production network of local and regional suppliers. Move to ChinaIn July 2015 another move was waiting for GÃ¤rtner then age 49 both geographically from South Korea to China as well as once more up the corporate ladder. GÃ¤rtner was to succeed Robert Veit as CEO of DTBC. Veit at age 47 was returning to Stuttgart headquarters in Germany to take the position of director of Mercedes-Benz Truck Overseas.This latest promotion clearly underscored Daimlerâ€™s confidence in GÃ¤rtner. China was the largest vehicle market in the world. And for Daimlerâ€™s Mercedes-Benz trucks China was already the fifth-largest market in 2012 with a market share of more than 50 per cent in the premium segment. In the heavy-duty segment Daimler solidified its position as the leader in the market. As of 2013 the trucks and buses division of DTBC pursued a two-pronged strategy. For the divisionâ€™s premium segment the legally independent company DTBC imported and sold Mercedes-Benz trucks. For the volume segment Daimler and Beiqi-Foton Motor Co. Ltd. (Foton) a Chinese truck manufacturer entered in a 50/50 joint venture as part of the Beijing Foton Daimler Automotive Co. Ltd. Since July 2012 they had been collaborating to manufacture and distribute the medium- and heavy-duty trucks of the Auman brand primarily for the domestic Chinese market. The joint venture was intended to bring a stronger presence for the company by combining Daimlerâ€™s leading truck manufacturing expertise with Fotonâ€™s understanding of the domestic market. GÃ¤rtner had full profit and loss responsibility for DTBC including new vehicle sales (trucks special trucks and buses) powertrain components after-sales (genuine parts lubricants and accessories) and telematics solutions for bus-specific fleet management.The disputeLife in China was not bad for GÃ¤rtner. He stayed in a gated community in the up-and-coming district of Shunyi a popular residential suburb in Northeast Beijing among other overseas executives. GÃ¤rtner had a nice house with a little garden and fence around it and a showy black Mercedes car in his driveway. However something inexplicable happened on Sunday morning November 20 2016. GÃ¤rtner was trying to park his car in a parking lot inside his residential compound and a Chinese driver was trying to do the same thing at the same time and in the same space. Apparently one of the two â€œstoleâ€ the parking space from the other starting a frustrated dispute that quickly heated up. GÃ¤rtner allegedly yelled â€œIâ€™ve been in China for a year and the first thing that I learned was that all Chinese are bastardsâ€ and defended his parking space with pepper spray. One onlooker was injured and had to be treated in the hospital for eye injuries. This incident landed GÃ¤rtner in a Chinese police station.In the end GÃ¤rtner was able to settle the dispute with the Chinese driver in a private manner and the official police investigation was quickly closed. However one of the driverâ€™s friends who was around when it all happened posted on social media his recollection of how GÃ¤rtner had screamed racial slurs to the Chinese passersby and how he unleashed pepper spray on them. The story soon went viral on Chinese media. The South China Morning Post quoted a social media post: â€œThis kind of foreigner is making money from Chinese people on one hand while insulting them at the same time. They hate China from the bottom of their hearts.â€Bloggers on Weibo (pronounced â€˜way-boreâ€™) a popular social media microblogging website in China with a market penetration similar to Twitter in the United States flooded the Daimler Group profile page calling for boycotts and demanding action. One blogger stated: â€œI was originally thinking about buying a Mercedes-Benz S-Class and was also planning to buy my wife a Mercedes-Benz GLC but this incident about the senior executive has made me deeply disappointed towards the brand. Mercedes-Benz get out of China!â€In yet another post a friend of the passerby who was treated in the hospital mournfully commented on the incident as an example of obnoxious foreigners: â€œThese kinds of foreigners take money from the Chinese people with one hand while also abusing them. They must hate China from the depths of their hearts.â€Further comments flooded into the original Weibo post that reported on the parking space dispute: â€œGet out of China! China doesnâ€™t welcome you.â€ â€œGÃ¤rtner should be deported and never allowed to enter China again.â€ â€œIâ€™ll never buy Benz even if I can afford it. The corporate culture is ugly.â€Global Times a popular Chinese newspaper regretfully commented on the incident: â€œBut no matter how filthy the words hearts should not be filthy. . . . Thereâ€™s no explaining away an argument that escalates to using â€˜You Chinese. . . .â€™â€The Southern Daily an official Chinese newspaper for the southern province of Guangdong was one of the few that featured a moderate editorial saying that â€œsome people think this was making a mountain out of a molehill.â€ However it also added that foreign expatriates in China easily become arrogant about China and â€œoften use racially prejudiced words and actions about Chinese consumers even Chinese employees.â€ The news about the GÃ¤rtner incident did not stay in China for long. It quickly spread across the world. International media such as Reuters took notice of the mounting tension regarding the incident carefully observing Daimlerâ€™s next move: â€œThe media reports prompted a spike in online chatter with the outburst in the top 10 discussed topics on popular microblog Sina Weibo on Monday morning. Many users posted comments saying they would avoid buying Daimler cars.â€Others such as the New York Times took a more reprimanding tone toward the German expatriate by commenting: â€œthe Chinese news media and many internet users seized on Mr. GÃ¤rtner as an example of arrogant Western bigotry and demanded that he and Daimler apologize. He became the latest example of the power of the Chinese internet to humble governments companies and people accused of wounding national pride.â€This was all very bad timing. The controversy over GÃ¤rtner came hard on the heels of another volatile episode involving 63-year-old GÃ¼nther H. Oettinger the European Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society from Germany. Oettinger had to apologize after referring to Chinese people as â€œslit-eyesâ€ and â€œsly dogsâ€ in a speech to business leaders in Hamburg. An amateur video was uploaded to YouTube capturing Oettingerâ€™s controversial speech in which he caricatured a delegation of Chinese officials he had met. During the first few days of criticism Oettinger refused to apologize causing Chinaâ€™s Foreign Ministry to condemn Oettinger for showing a â€œbaffling feeling of superiorityâ€ that is common among many Western politicians. A spokeswoman for Chinaâ€™s Foreign Ministry stated: â€œWe hope that they will learn to observe themselves and others objectively and to respect others and treat them as equals.â€ As the storm of criticism mounted Oettinger finally decided to apologize in a statement released by the European Commission. Oettinger acknowledged that he now realized his remarks to a German business forum last week had â€œhurtâ€ people. Relations between China and Germany were further affected when Germany withdrew approval for a Chinese investor groupâ€™s proposed takeover of German semiconductor equipment maker Aixtron citing concerns over national security. The withdrawal resulted in diplomatic tension between the two countries.moving forward GÃ¤rtnerâ€™s parking space quarrel in the suburb of Beijing not only resulted in outrage on Chinese social media. On the day of the incident Daimlerâ€™s share price started a downhill dive from â‚¬65.69 that 10 days later reached a low of â‚¬61.90. During the same time period the DAX remained steady and the Dow Jones Industrial Average even showed an upward movement (see Exhibit 1). What actions options did Daimler have to restore its brand image?Exhibit 1: Daimler share price compared to the Dow Jones Industrial averageNote: â‚¬ = EUR = euro; â‚¬1 = US$1.05 as of November 20 2016.

Our goal is to publish materials of the highest quality; submit any errata to publishcases@ivey.ca. i1v2e5y5pubsCopyright Â© 2019 Ivey Business School Foundation	Version: 2019-05-10On April 1 2017 Ye Ji founded a self-service retail platform for fresh meals called Flashfood.Shop in Dalian Liaoning province China. Flashfood.Shop used intelligent self-catering machines (ISM) as its physical sales terminals and an intelligent self-catering system (ISS) as its online service interface. Relying on fresh meals from catering suppliers Flashfood.Shop provided office workers with quick and affordable 24-hour catering services. After more than a year in development the platform was finally ready for normal operation.By the end of June 2018 Flashfood.Shop had launched 51 ISMs where customers could buy fresh meals from a vending machine. The company had 14 catering suppliers 135 different types of catering products and over 500000 customers. The average sales volume from a single ISM had increased from 8.43 to 30.25 servings per day which was a growth in average revenue turnover from Â¥121.51 to Â¥410.81 per day. The wastage rate of catering products had also dropped from the initial 27.97 per cent to 9.05 per cent. However behind the rapid development of Flashfood.Shop was a loss incurred in five consecutive quarters. After its establishment in April 2017 the companyâ€™s only income source was the sale of its catering products. At the same time its operating costs were high due to the instability of the ISMs and ISSs low operating efficiency and other factors. Faced with these issues Ji the founder and general manager of Flashfood.Shop was wondering how to resolve his companyâ€™s difficulties.backgroundWith the swift development of Chinaâ€™s economy and the improvement of peopleâ€™s per capita income level the population of Chinaâ€™s middle class reached 204 million in 2017.  These factors contributed to the rise of Chinaâ€™s catering market which reached nearly Â¥4 trillion (see Exhibit 1). Alternative business models to restaurant meals achieved explosive growth in China including fresh meals available via online food delivery in convenience stores and in self-service outlets. These three business models primarily targeted middle-class office workers and subsequently became the main source of meals for this segment. Generally office workers were urban people with high academic qualifications and a steady income and engaged in intellectual work.Online Food DeliveryOnline food delivery was an Internet-based business model where consumers could place an order online pay through a mobile payment application (app) such as WeChat Pay or Alipay and then wait for the fresh meal to be delivered to their doorstep. In 2011 with the establishment of domestic food-delivery companies such as Meituan Ele.me and Baidu Waimai the online food delivery industry was booming in China. In the growing stage of this industry these companies attracted more than Â¥70 billion in financing. As of June 2018 Meituan had successfully accumulated more than Â¥40 billion in multiple-round financing while Ele.me had raised over Â¥20 billion from investors. These funds effectively promoted the development of Chinaâ€™s online food-delivery market (see Exhibit 2). After nearly seven years of fierce competition Baidu Waimai was taken over by Ele.me in 2017 which shifted the landscape of Chinaâ€™s online food delivery market from a tripartite confrontation to a rivalry between Meituan and Ele.me.The main customers of online food-delivery retailing were office workers whose mealtimes were generally short because of high work intensity. Online food delivery allowed office workers to enjoy catering services in the office which greatly saved time. Gradually online food delivery also became a popular dining option for this group. According to a report by the think tank Analysis the sales volume of online food delivery for office workers reached Â¥38.13 billion accounting for 83 per cent of the overall online food delivery market. It was clear that online food delivery had become the most popular quick meal choice for Chinese office workers.Fresh Meals in Convenience StoresFresh meals in convenience stores provided customers with rice noodles wonton and other cooked meals in addition to traditional convenience store products such as basic necessities snacks and beverages. Because of the numerous convenience stores in business districts where office workers spent their day fresh meals in these stores gradually became an important option for quick meals for this group. In China the earliest companies to provide fresh meals in convenience stores were Lawson 7-Eleven and Family Mart. The stores provided bento boxed lunches vegetable salads fruits ice cream and other meal categories. The sales of fresh meals in convenience stores accounted for 30â€“40 per cent of total sales generally accounting for 40â€“70 per cent of gross margins. Therefore fresh meal retailing was the most important source of profit for these convenience stores. In recent years some convenience stores increased the proportion of fresh meal sales in their overall sales from an initial amount of 10 per cent up to 30â€“50 per cent.A report jointly released by the China Chain-Store & Franchise Association and the Boston Consulting Group noted that in 2016 the number of convenience stores in China reached nearly 100000 with a growth rate of 13 per cent and a market size exceeding Â¥130 billion.Self-Service Machines for Fresh MealsDespite the rapid expansion of the online food-delivery market and the increasing number of convenience stores in China there were drawbacks to both of these options. However self-service catering machines offering fresh meals seemed to be able to avoid the disadvantages of the other two types of retailers.Although the online food-delivery market was still expanding its growth rate had slowed significantly (see Exhibit 2) which highlighted problems with this option. The cost of delivery was too high an expense for companies providing online fresh meal services. In some Tier 2 cities such as Dalian delivery could cost Â¥10 per serving while in Tier 1 cities such as Beijing the cost was up to Â¥15 per serving for these companies which meant that online food delivery services were not profitable for fresh meal orders below Â¥30. In addition customers often complained about long waiting times during peak hours. Customers normally waited 40 minutes for their meals from the time the online order was placed to the time of delivery at their doorstep. During peak hours that time could reach more than one hour which was unacceptable for office workers who normally had only 60â€“90 minutes for their lunch break. There was also great demand for breakfast and midnight snacks but these companies were rarely able to provide delivery services at these times.The sale of fresh meals in convenience stores was also plagued with high rent and labour costs which led to high meal prices. Convenience stores were mainly located near office workplaces in business districts where rent costs were generally higher. For example in 2011 the monthly rent charge at a Beijing CBD office was Â¥300 per square metre; by 2014 it had reached Â¥1000 per square metre. Convenience stores also required at least two workers which had become more of an expense with increasing urban labour costs. For example Chinaâ€™s average employee salary had risen five times from 2008 to 2017. And although convenience stores were located near office areas workers were still required to walk approximately 300â€“1000 metres. Office workers who had become accustomed to eating meals without stepping outside their office found fresh meals from convenience stores a less appealing option.Self-service catering machines offering fresh meals seemed to resolve the problems incurred by both online and convenience stores. The self-service fresh meals option was a new business model that made use of intelligent technologies such as mobile payment face recognition and Radio Frequency Identification without requiring servers or cashiers. Compared to online food delivery self-service fresh meals could greatly reduce delivery costs through centralized distribution and could achieve high gross profit margins even with unit prices of Â¥30 or less. ISMs could provide 24-hour catering services covering breakfast lunch dinner afternoon tea and midnight snacks. Customers could receive their meal within 100 seconds of making their payment which greatly reduced waiting times. Compared to fresh meals sold in convenience stores the self-service business model enjoyed the advantages of low rent costs (for only 1 square metre) and no labour costs and provided office workers with shorter walking distances (usually within 100 metres) and less time wasted.According to an Ai Media Consulting report the market size of self-service retailing in China was Â¥38.94 billion in 2017. In the next five years Chinaâ€™s self-service retailing was expected to go through a high development period and the market was expected to see a growth rate of 281.30 per cent until 2020 to exceed Â¥1.8 trillion by 2022. The sale of self-service fresh meals was expected to reach a market size of Â¥24.1 billion in 2018 achieving a 50 per cent growth rate. The online catering market had developed rapidly in recent years but it was only able to capture a 4â€“6 per cent share of the overall catering market to date. Clearly the development of the online catering market was far from its saturation point; however the potential market space in this field was also an opportunity for self-service retail of fresh meals.founding of flashfood.shopOn April 1 2017 Ji founded Flashfood.Shop and established the self-service catering platform to provide fresh meals through the use of both ISMs and ISS platforms using both physical and online service interfaces. With fresh meals provided by catering suppliers the platform offered office workers affordable and convenient 24-hour catering services.Ji and His TeamJi had worked as a senior engineer for IBM in the past in information technology research and development. He had extensive experience in e-commerce multimedia information data management data retrieval and data mining. In 2010 Ji left IBM and formed a team of nearly 100 people to provide research and development services in software and e-commerce. He had also worked on the development of e-commerce system projects for Haier Group China Minsheng Bank and other companies.In 2014 Ji was hired by Baidu Waimai in Dalian where he worked for three years. The company was responsible for online and traditional food delivery promotion distribution operation maintenance and other services. During that time Ji accumulated a wealth of experience and insight into the development of the catering industry and e-commerce technology. That experience helped him discover and learn to resolve various problems inherent in two major marketsâ€”online and convenience store fresh food retailing. His solution was self-service catering of fresh meals. As a native of Dalian Ji had always hoped to build a Dalian-based unicorn enterprise. The opportunity that self-service catering of fresh meals promised made him see his vision more clearly and ignited his fighting spirit.At the beginning of 2017 Ji and his team began working on the development of Flashfood.Shop a self-service retailing platform of fresh meals. His entrepreneurial team consisted mainly of three groups of people. The first group was the information technology staff working on the software system development e-commerce data mining and other areas. The staff in the second group who had come from Baidu Waimai accumulated rich experience in the catering field. The third group consisted of Jiâ€™s friends whom he had invited to supplement the team and address any weaknesses. This group included Bin Zhang who was once Neusoftâ€™s senior business manager; Jingyi Han who had rich experience in restaurant brand design and had created more than 10 successful catering brands; Xiaopeng Yang who had been a senior marketing manager at Lawson convenience stores; and Yuanyuan Song who was once a senior leader of human resources in Tencentâ€™s head office. The above three groups together formed the entrepreneurial team of Flashfood.Shop (see Exhibit 3).The ISM and the ISSHardware: The ISMFlashfood.Shopâ€™s ISMs were physical hardware terminals for use by retail customers. They were composed of four main partition modulesâ€”refrigeration (for storing the products) heating transmission and display (for the purchase of fresh meals). To ensure the proper function and high quality of the ISM hardware Flashfood.Shop collaborated with Dalian Fushibingshan Vending Machine Co. Ltd. (Fushibingshan). Founded in 2003 Fushibingshan had grown to become Chinaâ€™s vending machine industry leader with total sales to date of 120000 vending machines.Flashfood.Shop and Fushibingshan workers focused their efforts on ensuring the proper function and stability of the hardware through iterative experiments. Fushibingshan was so convinced of Flashfood.Shopâ€™s prospects that it offered Â¥40 million in lease funding which greatly alleviated the new businessâ€™s financial pressure. After the successful development of the ISMs Fushibingshan trained engineering staff at Flashfood.Shop and then authorized and assisted staff members to carry out daily operations and maintenance work such as installation maintenance and repair.Software: The ISSFlashfood.Shopâ€™s ISS was the key to ensure proper operation of the companyâ€™s online platform. The system featured online display ordering and payment processes. The software enabled Flashfood.Shopâ€™s real-time monitoring of the quality and quantity of meals. As well the software enabled the company to conduct data statistics and other operational duties. The software system was developed strictly by Flashfood.Shopâ€™s team.Flashfood.Shopâ€™s ISS operated online via a built-in WeChat app without the need for downloading and installation. Customers could simply search for Flashfood.Shop on their WeChat apps to access the system. Based on their current location customers could choose the nearest machine and select their meal. After ordering and paying for the meal they would receive a code to retrieve their meal from the chosen catering machine. Customers could also purchase fresh meals directly from the ISM by selecting their desired meal on the machineâ€™s display clicking the corresponding picture and paying by scanning a code generated by the machine. The complete process could take only 20â€“100 seconds depending on whether the meal required heating. The operator interface of the ISM allowed Flashfood.Shop to perform a series of operations including machine monitoring meal monitoring shelf management and operation analysis.Suppliers and Customers of Flashfood.ShopEssentially Flashfood.Shop operated as a middleman platform that connected catering suppliers with customers thereby achieving supply and demand docking (see Exhibit 4).Catering SuppliersFlashfood.Shop had to attract suppliers to provide catering products for its ISM and customers to purchase the products. However the company was newly established and lacked brand recognition. Therefore it decided to use well-known food brands and high-quality catering products to attract customers. To ensure high-quality products the catering suppliers had to meet various standards. First their brand had to be well known to consumers. Second they had to have a central kitchen in Dalian to guarantee the quality of the food. Third the products provided by the supplier had to retain their colour and form after refrigeration or heating (if required). Fourth the products had to pass a series of Flashfood.Shopâ€™s quality and safety standards regarding production transportation and storage of the foods. Collaborating with suppliers Flashfood.Shop was able to provide 24-hour uninterrupted catering services with meals for breakfast lunch dinner afternoon tea and midnight snacks. By the end of 2018 Flashfood.Shop was providing 135 different types of catering products including Crispy Pork Chop Rice Orlean Roast Chicken Leg Rice and Black Pepper Beef Rice.CustomersFlashfood.Shop targeted mainly office workers so accurate placement of the ISMs near office workplaces was essential. To develop the perfect plan for site selection of the ISMs Ji invited professionals from Lawson to join the team and provide their expertise with the convenience store location model. After considering many site selection models Flashfood.Shop developed a standard process to evaluate potential sites based on user profiles strategic planning field research and standard models.operations of flashfood.shopDelivery SystemFlashfood.Shopâ€™s products had to be transported from the various catering suppliers to the ISMs before customers could make a purchase. Working with third-party logistics enterprises Flashfood.Shop developed a delivery system that used both four-wheeled vehicles and two-wheeled electric bicycles to transport the products (see Exhibit 5). Generally the four-wheeled vehicles would deliver all catering products to ISMs at 10 oâ€™clock every night. When a specific machine ran out of a product the two-wheeled electric bicycle would replenish the machine. The average delivery cost was reduced to about Â¥1.5 per serving through a centralized distribution system using the two types of vehicles. With more ISMs and with the optimization and upgrading of the delivery system that cost could be further reduced to an average of Â¥0.8 per serving. Delivery costs remained a major concern of online food delivery businesses with much higher rates of up to Â¥10 per serving in Tier 2 cities and Â¥15 per serving in Tier 1 cities. Rising rental and labour costs also resulted in high operating costs for convenience stores. However Flashfood.Shop was able to take advantage of centralized distribution of its catering products to reduce its delivery costs.Marketing and PromotionWith rich experience in catering promotion the Flashfood.Shop team had built a complete marketing and promotion process in four stages: customer research customer development continuous optimization and viscosity maintenance. For the first stage conducting customer research the marketing team prepared a questionnaire to gain basic information about potential customers within each ISMâ€™s radius. The information collected included consumption patterns consumption amounts meal preferences age distribution and male-to-female ratio. For the second stage to develop a customer base the marketing team promoted its catering products using flyers and posters and by directly inviting customers to participate in the product experience by establishing specific WeChat groups. For the third stage continuous optimization the team cultivated customer consumption behaviours through promotional activities. The marketing team also worked to increase the frequency of customer consumption levels and developed new customers by offering discounts for best selling items providing incentives for inviting friends to try the service giving one free item with the purchase of three meals and providing coupons for free meals. For the fourth stage viscosity maintenance the team continuously tracked and summarized customer behaviour and dynamically adjusted its sales strategy. The marketing team made adjustments to types of catered products and to promotion strategies based on background data aggregation and analysis and on customer feedback. The idea was to continuously enhance the customerâ€™s experience.Establishment of Standards for Self-Service Retail of Fresh MealsSelf-service retail standards were crucial for the operationâ€™s security and the companyâ€™s prominence in the industry for the future. As a leading company in the self-service retail of fresh meals Flashfood.Shop jointly formulated the industry standards in China with field experts including Wanchun Guo of the Dalian Food and Drug Administration Fushibingshan Dalian Acasia Food Co. Ltd. (Acasia) and Dalian Gongqingyuan Food Co. Ltd. (Gongqingyuan). The partners set standards for the complete process of food traceability packaging transportation and storage. They used various established industry standards as their source including the Hygienic Standard of Self-service Food Retailing and the National Food Safety Standard of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China.In regard to the standards for food traceability Flashfood.Shop collaborated with well-known catering brands such as Acasia and Gongqingyuan to provide each product with a unique identifier for ease of tracking. For the food packaging standards Flashfood.Shop set up specifications for appropriate grade and materials of paper towels spoons forks and meal boxes. When setting the food transportation standards cold chain equipment had to be provided during the transportation process so that the products could be kept at an appropriate temperature of 4 degrees Celsius or less. In reference to the food storage standards both the supplier and the operator were required to meet appropriate fresh-keeping conditions. For example catering suppliers had to guarantee that the products could be quickly cooled to below 10 degrees Celsius within 30 minutes after cooking to eliminate bacteria and lock in nutrient moisture. Catering operators like Flashfood.Shop also had to guarantee that the products were always kept at 0â€“4 degrees Celsius before purchase. For each product the catering operator was required to monitor the temperature and storage period in real time through the systemâ€™s back end. If a productâ€™s temperature or storage period exceeded the pre-set value an alarm would be immediately triggered.flashfood.shopâ€™s DilemmaFlashfood.Shop successfully built a self-service retail platform to connect catering suppliers of fresh meals with the targeted office worker consumers using ISM sales terminals and an ISS online service interface. It also kept the platform running while constructing a delivery system a marketing and promotion system and a set of standards for self-service retailing of fresh meals. By the end of June 2018 Flashfood.Shop had installed 51 ISMs in Zhongshan District Xigang District Shahekou District and Ganjingzi District in Dalian City with 14 catering suppliers and 135 different catered products. The number of customers exceeded the 500000 mark. Meanwhile the average sales volume of a single ISM increased from 8.43 servings per day to 30.25 servings per day with an average financial turnover increase from Â¥121.51 to Â¥410.81 per day. Also the rate of wastage of catering products dropped from the initial 27.97 per cent to 9.05 per cent.Ji was very happy to see such rapid development of Flashfood.Shop in just over one year. However behind the rapid development Flashfood.Shop was facing a loss in five consecutive quarters (see Exhibit 6). Although it was normal for start-ups to incur losses in their early stages Ji worried about his business. Flashfood.Shopâ€™s only current source of income was the sale of its catering products which was not enough to support the operation. Current delivery costs were Â¥1.5 per serving far from the optimal level of Â¥0.8 per serving.

(SpruceLand) faced a difficult decision. Since SpruceLandâ€™s inception in 1969 in the northern Alberta town of Slave Lake the company had a two-fold purpose: to earn a financial return and to engage in socially beneficial projects. SpruceLand was a community development company owned by individual members of the community. It had started through the sale of shares at CA$1 per share plus small investments from oil and gas companies entering the northern Alberta region as Albertaâ€™s energy sector was starting to take off.A critical need for infrastructure and real estate development in the region combined with the opportunities associated with the increasing presence of oil and gas companies meant that SpruceLand had grown steadily from the 1970s through to 2009. The expansion was impressive but the company had not been structured to grow as large as it had become. Shares would occasionally trade hands privately mostly between existing shareholders; by 2016 shares were trading at about $22 per share. This price was approximately half the net value per share of SpruceLandâ€™s properties themselves minus debt. The oil- and gas-fuelled Alberta economy had started to collapse in 2014 and now the board needed to make a difficult decision: Should it continue to operate as a profitable company with shares that were undervalued restructure or dissolve?NORTHERN ALBERTA REGIONThe northern Alberta region (the North) comprised 60 per cent of Albertaâ€™s land area (see Exhibit 1) but in 2011 it was home to less than 11 per cent of Albertaâ€™s population. The region was sparsely populated with a population density of just 0.97 persons per square kilometre compared with 5.7 persons per square kilometre for the rest of Alberta. With vast remote lands and awe-inspiring nature the North was often considered a â€œlast frontierâ€ that held immense opportunity for those who could stand the challenging weather and relative solitude.The 2011 National Household Survey revealed that the North had a relatively young population compared with the rest of Alberta and a 5.6 per cent unemployment rate with approximately 15 per cent of the population working in â€œmining quarrying and oil and gas extraction.â€ The survey also showed educational attainment levels largely similar to the rest of Alberta with two notable exceptions: the region had a higher proportion of both people with apprentice and trade credentials and people who lacked educational credentials. The region also had huge disparities with respect to where these two distinct groups were located: those people with the highest educational attainment levels tended to reside close to oil extraction activities.The regionâ€™s economic activity had steadily increased since the 1960s due to the discovery and subsequent extraction of oil and gas most notably in the Alberta oil sands. In 2011 workers in the Wood Buffalo region (Fort McMurray and area) earned nearly 90 per cent more than the median income in Alberta while other areas in the region generally fell below the median income for the province. The region was home to a relatively large Indigenous population comprising 18.4 per cent of the regionâ€™s total population compared with comprising 7.4 per cent of the overall population of Alberta. Almost 40 per cent of the population in the town of Slave Lake was Indigenous. The region was home to 28 First Nations and eight Metis settlements; however more than half of the Indigenous population lived off reserves or settlements. The former chief of the Sawridge First Nation Walter Twinn was one of the founding members of SpruceLand and had strongly advocated for more economic opportunities in the area.ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF NORTHERN ALBERTAAlthough the energy industry had contributed to the growth and development of the North the northern and southern parts of Alberta had historically experienced and continued to experience similarity in terms of peopleâ€™s standard of living opportunities for training and education and wages. The cost of living however was much higher in the North. In 2015 the North was still as a 1981 report suggested a resource of wealth for the South especially Calgary where most head offices for the energy industry and supporting services were located.The business of resource extraction had faced considerable booms and busts which had an immense impact on the North. Obtaining steady economic growth had been an ongoing concern. In addition to economic growth considerations for the future included social educational and cultural wealth. Commercial success did not guarantee social success and vice versa. Steady growth needed to be â€œsustainable social and economic development in the region in order to realize economic prosperity and a healthy society.â€ It had always been essential to find a way to ensure maximum positive social impact for residents of the area. When SpruceLand was first founded government reports described the North as â€œunderdevelopedâ€ (compared with the rest of Alberta) and the Alberta government had committed to community development efforts. The government recognized that the North had many strengths in terms of resources and opportunities but inherent in these strengths were also potential weaknesses: high costs the need for infrastructure and a small market. Transportation was listed as both a strength and a weakness. The government being the primary landowner in the North recommended interventions in terms of four development tools: (1) technical support (2) research and development (3) infrastructure and (4) financial incentives. The report however also came with the caveat that people needed to express â€œreal needs in a coordinative fashion while at the same time not making endless demands on the public purse.â€BACKGROUND of SPRUCELAND properties Inc. The town of Slave Lake was located in north-central Alberta roughly 260 kilometres north of Albertaâ€™s provincial capital Edmonton. When SpruceLand was founded its former president and chief executive officer (CEO) Preston Manning recalled Slave Lake as being in â€œrough shape.â€ The town did not have paved streets had virtually no rental accommodation or commercial space and the population was in decline. Prior to Manningâ€™s involvement and with the encouragement of a local civil servant Neil Gilliat five Slave Lake community members and local entrepreneursâ€”William Thomas Melvin Zachary Gordon Cook Joseph Mouallem and Walter Twinnâ€”had incorporated Slave Lake Developments Ltd. a â€œcommunity development companyâ€ with a two-fold purpose. They established that the company was to â€œearn profits for shareholders through the development of the physical resources of the Lesser Slave Lake region of Albertaâ€ and it was â€œto overcome the problems of social and economic underdevelopment in the region through the exercise of private enterprise and initiativeâ€ with the goal of attracting further investment and opportunities to engage in profitable business partnerships.Shortly after incorporation the founders approached Manning and his father Ernest Manning to ask for their assistance in developing the initial projects. The founders argued that Slave Lake had potential to become an oil field service town but a lot of work was needed to make that happen. The founders did not want to stand idly while the government awarded contracts to outsiders or while large companies moved in. Instead the founders wanted the community to actively participate and create opportunities for development. The Mannings agreed to be involved. Manning believed that the key to achieving SpruceLandâ€™s dual purpose was to obtain critical infrastructure and housing for Slave Lake and more economic opportunities for area residents. As a staunch conservative he argued that the solution was to gain access to the â€œtools of wealth creationâ€ and specifically access to markets. With the aim of providing shareholder opportunities to as many community members as possible Manning suggested reincorporating the company as a public unlisted company which would enable both a larger number of local shareholders and the possibility of pursuing joint ventures with incoming oil companies thereby ultimately creating wealth for stakeholders in a way that government transfers never could. In 1970 Manning became SpruceLandâ€™s inaugural president and CEO.A SOCIAL ENTERPRISESpruceLand was a rare example of an unlisted public corporation. It was â€œpublicâ€ because the corporation was registered (with the Alberta Securities Commission) as a reporting issuer. This registration required the regular public dissemination of the companyâ€™s annual and interim financial reports management discussion and analysis and several other reports. Early on the company requested relief from some regulatory costs and received an exemption to file semi-annually instead of quarterly. The company was â€œunlistedâ€ because the shares did not trade on a stock exchange such as the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) or the TSX Venture Exchange. An exchange listing required additional disclosures and costs and requirements related to governance size and liquidity. SpruceLand succeeded in attracting more than 300 community-based shareholders which required it to choose a public structure. SpruceLand championed a â€œcommunity focusâ€ which meant seeking local solutions to local problems rather than turning to external governments and companies. It was not a non-profit; instead as an early example of â€œa social enterpriseâ€ SpruceLand focused on both social objectives and modest returns. Manning argued that the best way to involve the community was to give people direct access to participate in the venture. Accordingly 65000 shares were sold at $1 per share and no shareholder was permitted to own more than 10 per cent of all shares available. It took 18 months to sell all the shares because few community members had been exposed to investment opportunities so many assumed it was a scam. Manning and his successors therefore placed a great emphasis on establishing rapport and trust with the local communities. The advantage of a social enterprise went beyond giving people access to investment opportunities. The investors were not speculators and the local focus of the company made it possible to invest in their own community. Other investors had overlooked the region because capital was difficult to access for projects; returns were not as high as most developers would want. In other words investors required a higher rate of return before investing illiquid assets in projects located in uncertain locations. In 1970 the available housing in the town of Slave Lake was largely either temporary or substandard. The Alberta government had labelled housing as a critical need for the region. Slave Lake needed housing for both its current population and to attract new skilled workers to the oil fields. To meet this need SpruceLandâ€™s first venture in Slave Lake was a 90-unit apartment and townhouse rental complex called Woodland Place. The mandate of the organization matched the project: to provide much-needed housing and to generate returns. The project cost $1 million and was funded partially with shareholder dollars combined with joint venture partners from the oil and gas industry: Imperial Oil Limited Exxon Mobil Corporation and Rainbow Pipe Line Company Limited. This initial capital enabled SpruceLand to take out a mortgage with the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. Woodland Place brought the much-needed workforce housing to the town and the project was an instant success. Within three years SpruceLand bought out its joint venture partners.GEOGRAPHICal EXPANSION AND REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO GROWTH In the years that followed SpruceLand turned a relatively small initial investment into a multimillion-dollar real estate portfolioâ€”but not without difficulty. Despite the success of Woodland Place Manning still needed to approach 35 mortgage companies in an attempt to secure a mortgage for SpruceLandâ€™s first commercial project in 1972: a 20000 square foot office building called Slave Lake Place. The mortgage lender which was also the areaâ€™s premier insurance company agreed to lend the funds only after Manning secured the Government of Alberta as the primary tenant. The Government would lease the space for offices and services rather than build its own facility thereby providing SpruceLand with market access that was otherwise out of reach. Three other projects followed: an office building an apartment building and a townhouse development all completed in the 1980s. SpruceLand started paying common share dividends in 1987. Manning resigned in 1987 to pursue a career in politics and Doug Victoor took over the reins of SpruceLand as president and CEO. Even through difficult economic times in the 1980s where prime rates were at more than 20 per cent Manning had paved the way for success with good initial investments collaborations with solid industry partners and a low debt to equity ratio. He had created a proven track record for SpruceLand which allowed Victoor to sell additional shares obtain financing for new projects and grow joint venture partnerships many of which were ongoing.With the help of trusted joint venture partners such as general contractors engineers and regulatory authorities Victoor skilfully and rapidly expanded SpruceLand with more residential and commercial/retail offerings within the Slave Lake region and beyond to other towns in the area. He also expanded outside the region entirely. SpruceLand bought apartment buildings in the towns of Athabasca St. Paul and Lac La Biche; several industrial properties in Nisku and Edmonton; and a mobile home park in Leduc. SpruceLand also invested in commercial space which it leased to retailers moving into the northern market. This expansion necessitated the name change from Slave Lake Developments Ltd. to SpruceLand Properties Inc.; Victoor realized that gaining shareholdersâ€™ trust in these new communities meant that the name of the company needed to reflect the broader regional focus. Victoor faced some backlash from shareholders who wanted the community development company to stay focused on the community of Slave Lake but he argued that the economic reality of working with increasingly bigger lenders necessitated diversification. The dividends during this time showed that Spruceland was successful. When Victoorâ€™s health started to decline in 2005 Steve Cribb was brought in as a consultant and in 2006 he became president and CEO. Cribb took over a growing company and capitalized on lower interest rates by refinancing properties selling older properties and buying newer ones. Where Victoor had first faced some resistance in expanding outside of Slave Lake and the region the economic case for expansion now resonated with shareholders and Cribb was able to continue in this direction. Cribb led SpruceLand through a period of intense growth by constantly evaluating the companyâ€™s diversification. He described the companyâ€™s growth as a natural evolution helped along by the improvement of processes and investments. The regulatory system had also changed since SpruceLandâ€™s inception and required an increasing degree of sophistication in business dealings. Shareholders were receiving annual dividends but if they wanted to sell their shares they needed to do so privately and were unable to achieve a price that reflected the value of the underlying assets. In 2015 SpruceLand had $120 million in assets (see Exhibit 2) which was likely too small for a public listing and too big for the original community-ownership model. In the meantime while the Board was considering current and developing market conditions and other related factors in September 2014 the Corporation received an unsolicited expression of interest from a western-based publicly traded entity (the â€œInitial Offerorâ€) regarding the sale of all or substantially all of the Corporationâ€™s assets. The Board determined that such an opportunity could be in the best interests of the Corporation and its Shareholders and consequently that it should consider the option.In the first quarter of 2015 oil prices had fallen from more than US$100 a barrel to less than US$50 (see Exhibit 3); however SpruceLand was conservatively positioned. The board knew that the extremely good conditions that SpruceLand had enjoyed for many years would not continue forever so it had been pursuing a strategic position that involved building up a significant (for the size of SpruceLand) cash reserve (see Exhibit 2). The cash reserve gave SpruceLand flexibility and protection in the event of a market event such as oil prices plummeting and an opportunity to take advantage of good buys when others needed to sell. The board was confident that SpruceLand was very well positioned.WINDING UP?The company was in good shape but the gap between asset value and market value was a problem especially as more of the original investors were starting to focus on estate planning. Why were investors trading the shares at such a low price relative to the property values? Meanwhile each year the company issued shares at the low valuation as part of a dividend reinvestment program (DRIP) (see Exhibit 4). Cribb and the board disliked that long-time shareholders who wanted to sell their holdings had to accept less than full value for their shares. Victoor who was still on the board described a market that was favourable for action: interest rates were dropping capitalization rates were down and appraisals were up. Financially winding up the company by selling the properties seemed to be a straightforward way to realize the full value per share provided the company could pull it off. However emotionally it was more complicated. SpruceLand had succeeded by keeping shareholders largely local with 75 per cent of roughly 300 shareholders located in the Slave Lake region. Over the companyâ€™s almost 50 years in the Slave Lake community it had made a positive impact throughout the region: $11 million had been distributed to shareholders as dividends and economic activity had been created through employee payrolls and company purchases made in the community. SpruceLand had enabled locals to participate in a venture and to be a part of the development of the region. Victoor recalled a deeply invested working board and employees who could buy shares and feel like they were working for themselves. The company had progressed from a single project to having a $120-million diversified real estate portfolio and in doing so the company had enriched peopleâ€™s lives both financially and socially. With the Alberta economy reeling from the freefall of oil prices the clock was ticking. Cribb and the board knew they needed to act to get surface value for shareholders. Should they dismantle Slave Lakeâ€™s innovative social enterprise success story use the companyâ€™s conservative positioning to take advantage of a market opportunity or restructure completely? What should the board do?EXHIBIT 1: MAP OF NORTHERN ALBERTANote: km = kilometres.Source: Created by the authors with assistance from Dr. Kwangyul Choi University of Calgary.

(Uber)â€™s chief product officer on April 25 2017 at the Uber Elevate Summit in Dallas Texas. â€œFlying cars have been promised for decades but are actually arriving nowâ€ said Holden. The self-proclaimed â€œChief Not-Satisfied Officerâ€ was excited to announce the launch of Uber Elevate Uberâ€™s latest venture that aimed to cut two-hour commutes to 15-minute rides in the sky by 2020. â€œIf youâ€™re not planting the seeds for five to ten years out youâ€™ll have no company in five to ten yearsâ€ said Holden. â€œIn that context itâ€™s very natural for Uber to turn its eyes to the air.â€ Holden and his team at Uber started Uber Elevate with the intent to revolutionize the transportation industry and position the company as the worldâ€™s first â€œurban air transportâ€ service. Flying cars would fundamentally change the way people were transported and would complement Uberâ€™s staple services on the ground setting the company up for future successâ€”so long as the company had a future. . . . On the same day it was estimated that Uberâ€™s private stock price was reduced by 15 per cent and its overall value by US$10 billion following a string of scandals that included sexual harassment claims intellectual property theft upper-management resignations and illegal software-related activity.On June 20 2017 Uber investors demanded that Uberâ€™s co-founder and chief executive officer (CEO) Travis Kalanick step down from his position leaving Jeff Holden and 13 other executives in charge of the company until a new CEO could be hired. Headlines read: â€œUber Appears to Be in Self Destruct Modeâ€ â€œCan Uber Be Saved from Itself?â€ and â€œUber Has a Leadership Void at a Time of Crisis.â€ With no CEO chief operating officer chief financial officer or chief marketing officer launching Uber Elevate became a Herculean task for Holden and his team. On August 28 2017 Uber had finally found its new CEO in Dara Khosrowshahi former CEO of the travel-booking behemoth Expedia. In his initial meeting with staff Khosrowshahi quickly noted that â€œThis company has to change.â€ He also emphasized his desire to take â€œbig shotsâ€ and possibly conduct an initial public offering (IPO) in the next 18â€“36 months. Could Uber Elevate be the companyâ€™s next â€œbig shotâ€? If so Holden would need to highlight the merits of flying cars to the new CEO. More importantly he and his team would need to articulate a strategy to get what would be named â€œUberAirâ€ into the marketplace. Otherwise Uber Elevate risked being shelved indefinitely. COMPANY BACKGROUND Founded in March 2009 by Travis Kalanick of Los Angeles California and Garrett Camp of Calgary Alberta Uber started as a taxi-like ridesharing service that secured patrons using a cellphone application (app) and GPS (Global Positioning System) technology. Less than two years later the company was valued at $60 million. At Uberâ€™s core customers were able to book a ride from an everyday driver at the press of a button. If you had a smartphone a licence a car car insurance and a clean driving record you qualified as an Uber driver. It was that easy. Kalanick and Camp chose a dynamic pricing model for Uber that charged riders in accordance with supply and demand. If there were few drivers and many customers Uber prices were high; if there were many drivers and few customers Uber prices were low. As the company grew it added to its taxi-like service by offering food delivery services (UberEats) business transportation services (Uber for Business) and freight services (Uber Freight). Ultimately Uberâ€™s vision was â€œto make transportation as reliable as running water.â€ By 2014 the companyâ€™s offering consisted of four ridesharing services: Economy Premium Accessibility and UberPool. UberPool was Jeff Holdenâ€™s brainchild and the ridesharing equivalent to carpooling. In May 2016 Uberâ€™s Advanced Technologies Group launched a fleet of self-driving cars in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania as a pilot project for what the company hoped would be the future of autonomous taxi service and freight delivery. By January 2 2017 Uber was hailed as the worldâ€™s most valuable start-up with a valuation of nearly $70 billion. By this point the company had serviced more than one billion rides in more than 600 cities. Proposed benefits of Uber included the following: (1) Uber led to fewer cars on the road which led to less traffic congestion and less pollution; (2) Uber reduced the need for parking spaces which took up one-fifth of the land mass in major cities; (3) Uber reduced the need for people to buy and service a vehicle of their own; (4) Uber had statistically demonstrated that it reduced driving-under-the-influence offences and alcohol-related deaths; and (5) Uber was a quick reliable and safe 24-hour ridesharing service.RECENT EVENTS AT UBERAfter surging from a $60 million valuation to a $70 billion valuation in less than six years Uber seemed unstoppableâ€”until June 2017 when Travis Kalanick was forced to step down as CEO following a seven-month snowball of scandals that included significant fines lawsuits federal investigations customer boycotts. and more as detailed below: December 2016: Uber employees admitted to regularly spying on high-profile individuals including politicians and celebrities. Without permits Uber tested an autonomous vehicle on the streets of San Francisco. The vehicle failed to stop at multiple red lights and put cyclists in danger. January 2017: Uber was fined $20 million for duping drivers. The company had falsely advertised earnings leaving drivers with far less money than promised. During a travel ban protest by the New York City Taxi Drivers Association Uber lifted â€œsurge pricingâ€ at the John F. Kennedy International Airport in an attempt to capitalize on the demand leading to a #DeleteUber campaign. February 2017: Travis Kalanick was forced to resign from Donald Trump's advisory council after users threatened to boycott the company. Former Uber engineer Susan Fowler went public about Uberâ€™s sexist and discriminatory culture which led to an investigation. Google filed a lawsuit against Uber claiming that the company had stolen autonomous transportation technology trade secrets. March 2017: Uber was caught using â€œGreyballâ€ technology that allowed drivers to evade law enforcement which led to a federal investigation. Travis Kalanick was caught on camera yelling at an Uber driver after the driver complained about â€œdeclining ratesâ€ and â€œhow hard it was to make a living off Uber.â€ Travis Kalanick and other senior employees visited an escort bar in Seoul Korea during a business trip leading to a human resources complaint from other employees on the trip. April 2017: Uber was caught using illegal software hacks and complicit drivers to spy on its major competitor Lyft. May 2017: Uber agreed to pay tens of millions of dollars to Uber drivers in New York City after the company kept a larger cut of the driversâ€™ profits than it was entitled to. June 2017: More than 20 Uber employees were fired following an investigation into sexual harassment claims and poor workplace culture. Uber executive Eric Alexander obtained the medical records of a woman raped by an Uber driver because he questioned the validity of her claim. Travis Kalanick took a leave of absence after an internal report was released regarding Uberâ€™s horrendous corporate culture. In an all-staff meeting to combat Uberâ€™s toxic work environment board member David Bonderman made a sexist joke forcing him to resign from his position hours later. Uberâ€™s largest investor hand-delivered a letter to Travis Kalanick demanding he step down as CEO. As a result of these blunders by June 22 2017 (two days after Kalanickâ€™s departure) Uberâ€™s valuation plummeted by nearly $20 billion. Since launching in 2009 the company was facing its first real hardship which had led to 12 upper management departures and voids in critical executive positions.JEFF HOLDENOn February 14 2014 Travis Kalanick was â€œsuper-pumpedâ€ to announce the hiring of Jeff Holden as Uberâ€™s new chief product officer (CPO). Holden former vice-president of product development at Groupon was hired to â€œsolve Uberâ€™s hardest problems and invent [the companyâ€™s] future.â€ Kalanick had been drawn to Holden because of his previous experience at Amazon where he had been described as â€œthe â€˜mercuryâ€™ planet orbiting closest to Jeff Bezosâ€™ Sun.â€ It was an impressive post given that Bezos was at the time the richest man in the world. Holdenâ€™s tenure at Amazon prepared him for the turbulence that came with working for a â€œhyper-growthâ€ firm giving him the experience and poise needed to scale Uber and take the company to the next level. His experience proved to be of benefit during Holdenâ€™s first major project â€œUberPoolâ€ which was a smashing success that accounted for 20 per cent of all Uber drives by April 2017. Given Holdenâ€™s achievements the CPO was given full authority to lead Uber into the future resulting in Uber Elevate or what had been named â€œUberAir.â€ In a 100-page white paper elaborating on the who what when where and why of flying cars Holden and his team believed that the future of commuting lay in Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) transportation: On-demand aviation has the potential to radically improve urban mobility giving people back time lost in their daily commutes. . . . Just as skyscrapers allowed cities to use limited land more efficiently urban air transportation will use three-dimensional airspace to alleviate transportation congestion on the ground. A network of small electric aircraft that take off and land vertically (called Vertical Take-off and Landing or VTOL and pronounced vee-tol) will enable rapid reliable transportation between suburbs and cities and ultimately within cities. ELECTRIC VERTICAL TAKEOFF AND LANDINGâ€œThe Elevate white paper articulated our thought process; why not urban aviation? Why canâ€™t we do this?â€ asked Holden at the Uber Elevate Summit. â€œI hate the term flying cars but weâ€™re going to have to live with itâ€ he said. To the audience it may have seemed that electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft served the same purpose as cars (i.e. getting people from point A to point B) but in Holdenâ€™s eyes they were considerably different. However powering the eVTOL aircraft used an amount of electricity comparable to that of a small grocery store causing Holden and his team to admit that their energy consumption posed a feasibility barrier in terms of latent battery technology. Other barriers to eVTOL included the certification process vehicle efficiency vehicle performance and reliability air traffic control cost and affordability safety aircraft noise emissions city infrastructure and pilot training. Uber would have much to overcome if the company wanted to see UberAir come to life. After releasing the white paper critics of Uber Elevate believed that Uber needed a reality check that the companyâ€™s flying car plans were a fantasy and as Tesla visionary Elon Musk put it: â€œitâ€™s difficult to imagine the flying car becoming a scalable solution.â€Holden responded in his closing remarks at the Uber Elevate Summit on April 26 2017 stating â€œThere have been hundreds of articles written very favorable and very excited . . . and very much about the clear transition from skepticism into â€˜Hey I think this is actually going to happenâ€™ and thatâ€™s incredibly exciting.â€ Holden proclaimed that he and his team had partnered with leading eVTOL manufacturers high-profile investors air traffic control executives influential politicians and policy makers NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) scientists elite engineers and other eVTOL specialists who shared the belief that Uber Elevate could and would be successful. â€œEveryone has as much passion as the Elevate team to bring this future to fruitionâ€ said Holden. â€œIn order to hit these ambitious goals . . . weâ€™re going to need to put the pedal down.â€ Continuing with his speech Holden stated that Uberâ€™s eVTOL aircraft could be expected to launch in two citiesâ€”Dallas Texas and Dubai United Arab Emiratesâ€”by 2020. The initial UberAir service in the United States would travel from Frisco Station Texas to the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (a drive that normally took 70 minutes) in an estimated eight minutes (see Exhibit 1). Similarly the United Arab Emirates route travelling from Jumeirah Beach to the Dubai International Airport would turn a 45-minute automobile commute into an estimated seven-minute eVTOL flight (see Exhibit 2) thereby solidifying Holdenâ€™s claim that on-demand aviation would be an incredibly time-saving and efficient mode of transportation (see Exhibits 3 and 4). VEHICLE PERFORMANCEBy April 2017 Uber had partnered with industry-leading manufacturers such as Bell Helicopter Aurora Flight Sciences Pipistrel Mooney and Embraer. This ecosystem along with Uberâ€™s other various partners had been assembled to design eVTOL aircraft that most notably would be able to accomplish the following goals: (1) vertically take off and land in 30 seconds and hover for up to one minute; (2) reach cruising speeds between 150 and 230 miles (240 to 370 kilometres) per hour; (3) carry a minimum of two to a maximum of four people (including a pilot); (4) travel a minimum 50-mile (80-kilometre) round trip at maximum speed; and (5) have fully autonomous capabilities. RIDER EXPERIENCEJeff Holden credited Uberâ€™s previous success to the companyâ€™s â€œmagical ride experienceâ€ and ensured customers that UberAir would deliver just that. In the Uber Elevate white paper Holden noted that UberAir would complement traditional transportation methods. In a best-case scenario UberAir would take riders directly to their destination. In a worst-case scenario UberAir combined with Uberâ€™s ground services and/or public transportation would transport customers from point to point. Similar to Uberâ€™s traditional ridesharing services selecting UberAir on the companyâ€™s app would provide riders with an itinerary including sequenced walking or driving directions on either end of a trip making any commute easy to navigate (see Exhibit 5). According to Holden and his team boarding an eVTOL aircraft would require minimal assistance. Most aircraft would have direct access by elevator (if on top of a building) or by an automobile drop-off entrance (if on the ground). The white paper stated that Uber planned on building sheltered waiting portals that also provided customers with washrooms refreshments instructional information and signage on what to expect. Before boarding riders would be directed to their eVTOL aircraft where theyâ€™d be allowed to stow bags or luggage. Once boarded and ready for departure the eVTOL aircraft would take approximately 30 seconds to propel upward in its vertical takeoff. Once in the air Holden noted that passengers could expect the same noise level as a commercial aircraft flight. Unlike a helicopter ride riders would not need to wear noise-cancelling headphones. Within the cabin passengers would be able to access real-time trip information including location and remaining time. Finally upon arrival riders would have the option to take Uber ground transportation service to a second destination if needed. SAFETY CONCERNSSafety concerns for Uber Elevate included severe weather pilot error loss of situational awareness engine failure battery failure injury due to turbulence landing errors birds and other aerial hazards. Despite these concerns Uber vowed to make eVTOL aircrafts twice as safe as cars; however doing so might prove challenging. Historically per 100000 driving miles (160000 kilometres) fatality rates in the United States were two times greater in air taxis than in cars. However the company understood that a high level of perceived safety was critical for early adoption and that this safety goal needed to be achieved for UberAir to be a success. URBAN INFRASTRUCTUREUber planned on taking advantage of already established infrastructure in major cities such as Los Angeles and San Francisco. For example downtown Los Angeles had 40 high-rise helipads that the company wished to convert into â€œvertiportsâ€ and â€œvertistops.â€ Vertiports (see Exhibit 6) were designed to be eVTOL hubs with multiple takeoff and landing sites along with charging stations and small maintenance spaces. Vertistops (see Exhibit 7) were designed to be single pads for drop-off and pickup. Although new infrastructure would be needed Uber was primarily focused on repurposing existing assets which it believed would be the most cost-effective and efficient way forward. For Uber repurposing a highway cloverleaf was one type of infrastructure thought to offer several advantages as a vertistop site including less stringent noise standards over highways clear paths of transport and less conflict with private property. Other areas that UberAir desired to utilize included roofs of parking garages office towers harbour-side barrages and existing spaces such as parking lots. ECONOMICS AND FEASIBILITYInitial costs were estimated to be significant; near-term costs expensive; and long-term costs advantageous. In launching UberAir economy-of-scale forces were significant and represented a material input for the costs associated with the service over time.It was estimated that the eVTOL aircraft would be utilized 50 per cent of the time (between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. each weekday)Â for 260 days per year. Maintaining such rates of utilization was thought to be critical for UberAirâ€™s business model to succeed. It was believed that eVTOL aircraft would have a useful life of 13 years and a salvage value of 30 per cent of production costs which equated to approximately 400000 miles (640 kilometres) per year and 5 million miles (8 million kilometres) per aircraft. Meanwhile battery power costs were pegged at $0.12 per kilowatt hour (kWh) while the successful eVTOL prototype was expected to achieve 2 miles/kWh (3 kilometres/kWh) or better. During the initial stage and the near-term stage piloting needs were assumed to be 1.5 pilots per aircraft at $50000 per salary. Pilots would need a sport aircraft licence to operate an eVTOL aircraft. In the long term a $60000 improvement to avionics was assumed which would drop the cost of piloting. When artificial intelligence (AI) was employed to pilot eVTOL aircrafts in the future the need for pilots would decrease to one-eighth as a virtual flight deck would be available in case emergency human intervention was needed. The total cost per eVTOL aircraft in the initial stage had been estimated to be approximately $1.2 million with 100 units manufactured. Near-term costs were estimated at $600000 with 500 units manufactured. In the long term costs were estimated at $200000 with 5000 units manufactured. Travel distances needed to be sufficient to gain efficiency over current transportation options. At slow speeds automobiles provided a more efficient form of transport but as speeds increased automobile efficiency decreased. Unlike automobiles eVTOL efficiency had been proven to increase with speed to a point of maximum efficiency before declining. The eVTOL aircraftâ€™s efficiency would be maximized at approximately 125 miles (200 kilometres) per hour (see Exhibit 8). COMPETITIONUber intended to be an intermediary between passengers and eVTOL aircraft. As a result competition in this space was relatively narrow. Uberâ€™s main competitor in the â€œpush a button get a flightâ€ sector was the same as its primary competitor on landâ€”Lyft. Although Lyft had yet to take a stance on entering the flying car market the company had the rider base and technology needed to challenge Uber in this domain. Several other competitors were looking to make flying cars a reality by 2020. For example eVolo the German eVTOL manufacturer was on the verge of piloting an air-taxi service. The Volocopter 2X could fit two people and fly for up to 17 minutes on a 40-minute charge. Another company A3 was developing a single-passenger eVTOL aircraft that was expected to pilot by the end of 2017. The company planned on making trips on the aircraft as affordable as a taxi by 2020. Airbus was working on CityAirbus an UberPool-style flying drone that could be booked by multiple patrons via an app. The Chinese drone company EHang launched its flying-taxi prototype in July 2017 in the city of Dubai. It was able to carry 220 pounds (100 kilograms) and cruise at more than 60 miles per hour (100 kilometres per hour). Another company Terrafugia was building an eVTOL hybrid that could take off fly and land autonomously. Drivers needed a sport pilot licence to operate the vehicle. Yet another company Kitty Hawk was working on a Google-associated single-passenger eVTOL aircraft which was expected to launch by 2020. It could only be flown over water however.More broadly UberAir was competing against alternative modes of futuristic transportation such as Hyperloop. The American bullet-through-a-chamber-like transportation company which had top speeds as high as 700 miles per hour (1100 kilometres per hour) claimed it would be able to transport people and/or things from Los Angeles California to Las Vegas Nevada in 30 minutes or less (a drive that normally took 4.5 hours) for as little as $20. LOOKING FORWARDIn his closing remarks at the Uber Elevate Summit Holden told the audience and those watching around the world that â€œhis hope and dream is to be at scale with Elevate as part of our daily lives in 10 years.â€ He believed however that â€œweâ€™ll be seeing it around everywhere well before that.â€ With the hiring of Dara Khosrowshahi Holden understood the importance to the new CEO of solidifying Uber Elevateâ€™s worth both strategically and financially. With so many challenges facing Uberâ€™s business model and threatening the companyâ€™s future was it the right time to proceed with Uber Elevate? How could Holden be sure that UberAir could and would be the success that he and his partners believed it would be? What steps were needed to ensure such success? These were only a few of the questions that Holden had to ask himself before pitching Uber Elevate as the companyâ€™s next â€œbig shotâ€ to both Dara Khosrowshahi and the board of directors. Not lacking faith in the project Holden wrapped up his speech at the Uber Elevate Summit by stating â€œI can say with great confidence every rider everywhere is going to be excited about this and want to take advantage of the UberAir service. . . . Together weâ€™re inventing the future of transportation.â€Exhibit 1: UberAIRâ€™s Estimated Travel Time from Dallas to Frisco Station TexasSource: Jeff Holden â€œUber Elevate & The Future of Urban Mobilityâ€ April 25 2017 accessed September 1 2017https://uber.app.box.com/s/jv1p4nwt4ijo67f3fss1098d9wog7bmd.

(Eco Tasar) was not his usual cheerful self. He seemed rather annoyed. Pandya was feeling frustrated that in spite of his best efforts to help all employees understand accept and value the business of the organization he was struggling with his sales team. How could he find an employee who was a good fit for his sales team?Pandya A Social Entrepreneur in the MakingPandya had graduated from a premier business school in India in 1990. In a campus selection at his college he was the first in his class to be hired by a prestigious public sector undertaking (PSU) a government-owned company. Six months into his job Pandya was unhappy as he did not find the work to be sufficiently challenging. With his strong entrepreneurial bent Pandya harboured a strong desire to create a business of his own. Although he was newly married Pandya quit his easy job in the PSU after just over a year. Over the next eight years he worked on several different assignments which led to hardships but also satisfied his hunger for challenges. In 2000 he joined the Professional Assistance for Development Action (PRADAN) a national non-governmental organization (NGO) in India that worked for the economic betterment of tribal communities in the villages of the Indian state of Jharkhand. PRADAN helped the traditional Tasar silk cocoon rearers by providing techno-managerial support to increase their incomes from cocoon rearing. PRADAN also organized women from poor households to take up an income-generating activity such as yarn making from the silk cocoons that were available locally. Pandya was hired to help the organization set up the market linkage for the yarn made by the women in the villages. Subsequently in 2004 PRADAN facilitated the setting up of Masuta Producers Co. Ltd. a company owned by the yarn makers themselves. The company was staffed with professionals who helped manage the centralized purchase of raw material. The professionals also helped in the marketing of the yarn directly to the weaving communities through value additionâ€”that is by making the yarn into fabric and other woven items.Pandya who was looking after the marketing of yarn and also the fabric division at PRADAN decided to strike out on his own. He and Masuta Producers Co. Ltd. agreed to set up the fabric division as a separate joint venture (JV) wherein Masuta Producers Co. Ltd. provided the initial capital and Pandya managed this company as a co-owner.PRADAN too realized that it would be better for Masuta Producers Co. Ltd. to remain focused on the activity of yarn production and to create a separate entity to undertake the activity of adding value to the yarn by converting it into such products as sarees stoles dupattas and bedcovers and then selling these products in the market. Pandya succeeded in convincing the top management of PRADAN that such an action would be a prudent business decision and in the best interests of the community. In 2007 PRADAN promoted Eco Tasar Silk Private Limited a JV company formed between Masuta Producers Co. Ltd. and Khitish Pandya the social entrepreneur. The JV served three purposes: first it helped to expand the demand for Masuta Producers Co. Ltd.â€™s yarn by using it in its own production; second its activities generated income for Masuta Producers Co. Ltd. which helped Masuta Producers Co. Ltd. to stabilize its otherwise commodity-based business; third it served as an outlet for introducing to the market designs made using Masuta Producers Co. Ltd. yarn. the Handloom Industry in India: A Peek into the Business DynamicsThe Indian handloom industry operated by weavers who had a deep sense of art and culture was a true reflection on the diversity and richness of Indian culture. Indian handloom products had always been known for their unique designs and finesse. Handloom products were exceptional by the virtue of the handloomâ€™s flexibility and versatility which encouraged experimentation. Handlooms were superior to power looms because of their ability to introduce innovative designs which the power loom could not replicate. The handloom industry engaged nearly six million workers making it the second-largest employment provider for the rural population in India after agriculture. This sector contributed nearly 19 per cent of the total cloth produced in India and added substantially to export earnings.SilkWorldwide India was second only to China in silk production accounting for almost 18 per cent of global raw silk production. India produced more than 28 thousand tons of silk per annum with sericulture activities spread across more than 52000 villages. India enjoyed a unique position in sericulture as it produced all the commercially useful varieties of silk. The Indian silk industry was a major generator of both employment and foreign exchange for the country. Key Markets In the financial year (FY) 2015â€“16 Indian silk exports stood at US$181.5 million. Most of the export earnings came from ready-made silk garments which accounted for almost 74 per cent of the total silk export earnings. Natural silk yarn and fabrics comprised 24 per cent of silk export earnings. The major export markets of Indian silk goods were the United Arab Emirates and the United States. Western Europe was another major market with the United Kingdom France Italy and Germany being the main importers of silk products. The silk products exported included ready-made garments fabrics carpets and natural silk yarn.Tasar SilkTasar was a copper-coloured coarse silk mainly used for furnishings and interiors. It was less lustrous than mulberry silk but had its own feel and appeal. Tasar silk was produced by a silkworm that mainly thrived on a specific variety of trees found in only certain areas of India. The rearing of the worm was done in a natural way on trees in the open. In India the states of Bihar and Jharkhand were the largest Tasar silk producers and Tasar culture was a mainstay for many of their tribal communities. Tasar silk was also produced in the states of Chhattisgarh Odisha Maharashtra West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh. The demand for Indian Tasar silk had witnessed modest growth between 2010 and 2013. Earnings from the export of Tasar silk goods grew from $50 millionÂ in FY 2010â€“11 to $54 millionÂ in FY 2012â€“13. The sector had been growing steadily albeit at a moderate pace.The Ecosystem for handloom silkHandloom weaving was a prevalent economic activity in many rural parts of India. A large section of the rural population was completely dependent on this activity as their only source of livelihood. Despite the various government-launched programs to promote the handloom silk sector it faced numerous challenges. Firstly the sector competed with power looms which benefited from economies of scale leading to a lower production cost compared with the cost of producing similar products using the handloom. Compared with handlooms power looms offered both a more competitive selling price and a profit margin advantage. Secondly compared with power looms handloom production technology because of its dependence on the speed and skill of the weaver required more time to produce a given quantity of product. As a result in the handloom market supply was unable to match demand. Thus managing supply order deadlines was often a challenge for companies offering handloom silk products. This situation led to missed sales opportunities even when the market had the potential to buy more products. The power loom players regularly exploited this situation as they were easily able to fill the demandâ€“supply gap. Thirdly the new generation in the silk weaver community was steadily moving toward adopting other vocations. This trend was a result of traditional weaving being seen as less economically beneficial compared with other vocations. As a result with each passing year fewer skilled weavers were available to drive the handloom industry. Fourthly the silk handloom sector was largely unorganized with a large number of small players who were in most cases sole proprietorships. In such an environment assuring quality and best practices to the customers remained a challenge. Last but not the least customers in the domestic (i.e. Indian) market were price-sensitive. Also most domestic customers did not differentiate between handloom and power loom products which led to adverse conditions for handloom products and favourable conditions for power loom products. In the export market especially in North America and Europe customers valued the exotic and creative qualities of handloom fabrics. However this market was sensitive about product quality conformity to international standards on production processes and prompt delivery of products. For the Indian silk handloom sector these requirements continued to remain a challenge. The buying behaviour of the customers of silk products as explained above distinctly segmented the market into two categories. One market segment was niche catering to select discerning customers mostly in Europe North America and the Middle East. The niche segment had some presence in India; however this customer base constituted a very small fraction of the overall potential customer base. The other market segment comprised solely the customers in India the local market who were very price-sensitive and often did not differentiate between handloom and power loom products. This market segment dictated the need for different products and marketing strategies as per the requirements of a particular market segment. Eco Tasarâ€™s Business PhilosophyPandyaâ€™s vision was to create a social enterprise that was not just self-sustaining but also commercially competitive to ensure that it remained capable of effectively supporting the social cause at its core. In line with his vision Pandya incorporated Eco Tasar with the objective of building a business that created wage opportunities for a large number of producers of handmade yarn handloom weavers and other producers in the textiles value chain by promoting a sustainable and fair business model. Guided and supported by eminent individuals from the social work arena including Deep Joshi a Ramon Magsaysay Award winner; Satyabrata Acharya; and Anish Kumar Pandya formulated the mission of the organization as follows: â€œCreation of wage opportunity for a large number of producers of handmade yarn handloom weavers and other producers in the textiles value chain through a sustainable and fair business model.â€Eco Tasarâ€™s Growth Story From humble beginnings Eco Tasar had grown to a strong team of 89 members working full-time for the organization. From only $0.35 million in revenue in FY 2008â€“09 the company had boosted its revenue to $2.8 million in FY 2015â€“16. The company had grown at a compounded annual growth rate of 30 per cent over the past five years (see Exhibit 1).Over time Eco Tasar had specialized in Tasar and Eri silks. Its expertise was in making well-designed handwoven products using hand-spun silk yarn. The company offered a wide range of high-quality Tasar products that included such off-the-loom items as scarves stoles sarees and shawls and fabricated items such as cushion and duvet covers. Eco Tasarâ€™s overall number of stock keeping units ranged between 2000 and 3000 items that were sourced directly from the artisans. Weaving and dyeing was done as close to the artisans as possible. Lastly and most importantly Eco Tasar had chosen the path of using only handmade yarn or fabric and had never been enticed by the lure of power looms. Eco Tasar was focused on design-driven products. The contemporary designs which exuded an aesthetically understated elegance appealed to contemporary working women. The products were positioned in the mid-price bracket making them attractive to those who desired elegance at affordableÂ cost. Eco Tasar was known for providing designs and weaving styles to unserviced and under-serviced markets giving it an edge over local wholesale suppliers which typically did not carry such inventory. Moreover Eco Tasar introduced a large number of designs in quick succession which kept buyersâ€™ interest alive. Eco Tasar invested in a fabrication unit to make and sell cushion covers and other home furnishings. It also expanded its weaving base from Bhagalpur to Fulia in West Bengal a state in northeast India and was also exploring weaving clusters in South India. It supplied stores across India and exported to the United States the United Kingdom Germany Italy France Colombia South Africa Japan Malaysia Australia Spain and Greece. Its clients included Fabindia Tribes Nalli Cinnamon Amethyst Casablanca and Parthas in India; West Elm (sister brand of Pottery Barn Group) John Robshaw Textiles Novica Sevya and Fair Trade Original in the United States and Europe; The White Company in the United Kingdom; and Amor Collections in the Netherlands.Eco Tasar was on an expansion mission to create greater demand for Tasar silk yarn. The company was leveraging its marketing outreach to help women yarn makers in Madhya Pradesh and Assam especially those living in poverty by providing technical training and by sourcing yarn from them. Eco Tasar continued to support Masuta Producers Co. Ltd. by buying more than 30 per cent of the yarn it produced.In the past decade Eco Tasarâ€™s social program in collaboration with PRADAN and other NGOs such as Grameen Sahara had made a definitive impact in the lives of thousands of village men and women the yarn makers and weavers. The enterprise undertook a major scaling-up of its operations from 590 artisans in FY 2011â€“12 to 1954 artisans by FY 2013â€“14 disbursing almost $0.73 million in wages.Eco Tasar aspired to emerge as a leading player in the handloom silk market by 2020. It had set high benchmarks in the areas of market and social impact and planned to achieve the set standards by employing best practices and the latest technology in all facets of the value chain. The growth vision and the focus areas of the company are summarized in Exhibit 2.In 2012 Eco Tasar was recognized with a Sankalp-Samridhi Award for creating a business that in addition to being viable and competitive focused on the welfare of artisans living in poverty. Eco Tasar was also recognized as a valued partner in testimonials posted by clients such as West Elm.Challenges along the Growth PathPandya was satisfied with the growth of his business. He enjoyed receiving recognition in the industry and the company had achieved a comfortable market share. His supplier and distribution networks were stable. He had good employees and valued their loyalty. The attrition rate of his employees was lower than that of the industry. However the path of growth had its challenges. In the early days of the organization Pandya had a small team that included designers production personnel and an accountant. In addition to managing the complete administration of the business Pandya also handled the important functions of marketing and sales although his designers sometimes pitched in to also act as marketing professionals. This arrangement continued for some time; however as the company grew Pandya started to feel stressed while also managing other functions. â€œItâ€™s time to look for a few marketing professionalsâ€ Pandya thought. To drive sales he decided to hire young graduates who had qualifications in the domain of design. Pandya assumed that it would be easy to train these young minds. the Decision to Hire Marketing Professionals with ExperienceOne day when Pandya arrived early at the office he was surprised to see the designer Jatin Chandra already at work trying to clear some backlog as he was expecting a new order. Pandya sat down with Chandra and said that he wanted to share some of his concerns with him. Pandya said that the company had hired some talented young employees to handle the marketing tasks but that the required training was draining his energy. He said that despite all his efforts he still received unexpected calls from those employees when they were unable to handle customersâ€™ queries. He noted â€œIt does put me off but then they are not to blame. Maybe they are not experienced enough to handle such queries and maybe they will take some more time to learn.â€ Chandra advised Pandya that in view of the scale at which the business was growing it was time for the sales responsibility to be handled by people who had experience. The day carried on as usual but Pandya ruminated over Chandraâ€™s suggestion. Finally by the end of the day he concluded that Chandraâ€™s suggestion was a good idea that merited implementation.Pandya arranged for advertisements to be published in the leading daily newspapers seeking suitable candidates for positions of marketing professionals. Response to the advertisement was good. Several candidates from larger export houses responded; in most cases they desired to change jobs mostly for a salary increase and a higher position. After screening the candidates Manish Mathur was selected. Mathur had 11 yearsâ€™ experience in marketing at a mid-sized textile firm that used power loom technology. Pandya mused â€œWith a 20 per cent hike over his current salary as per his expectations Mathur should be motivated enough to put in his best. His experience will help us boost our sales and I can concentrate on operations.â€the Baggage of past work experience On May 1 2008 Mathur joined Eco Tasar and began two weeks of orientation. Pandya had Mathur accompany him to all his meetings and encouraged him to ask as many questions as needed to clarify any uncertainties. In his initial five months Mathur did his best by meeting with clients and trying to convince them of the romance of handwoven textiles. With persistent efforts Mathur was able to secure larger orders from existing clients and he was successful in developing two new clients which marginally increased sales. Mathur was settling in well and he expected to secure larger deals in the near future. This trend was also reflected in his sales results curve in previous companies: gradual at first and increasingly steep thereafter. Mathur set challenging goals and shared them with Pandya. Pandya was happy to see enthusiasm in his new marketing manager but advised him to be realistic and patient in his approach as this market differed from the markets that Mathur had previously dealt with. As time passed Mathurâ€™s body language started to reflect what seemed to be impatience and disappointment. He was planning to achieve sales growth at exponential scales and yet he was struggling to achieve even low linear growth. Sales were not moving as expected but Pandya did not become impatient.One day Pandya saw Mathur in an animated discussion with the finance manager in his cubicle. He went closer and overheard Mathur saying â€œIt is no fun doing business with such small timers. I have never been used to catering to small customers. At bigger companies you get to make bigger sales and accordingly your incentives shoot up.â€ Initially Mathur had not noticed Pandya approaching. When he did see Pandya Mathur and the manager stood up and greeted him. Pandya greeted them back and sat down with them. Having overheard Mathurâ€™s complaint Pandya addressed him: â€œI can see that you possibly are a little dissatisfied with the kind of transactions you are handling. You do not seem to be comfortable with having to deal with multiple albeit smaller customers. You are rather more comfortable in working on fewer but larger deals.â€ Pandya further said â€œThat is the challenge here. Every business encounters different challenges and that is where you get to learn and grow.â€ â€œI will be able to make huge sales if it were not just handloom products. There is no point being rigid about this; business needs to make better profitsâ€ shot back Mathur. Such conversations would continue endlessly but Mathur made no attempt to try to adapt to the situation. One and one-half years into Mathurâ€™s job Pandya called Mathur and said that Mathurâ€™s discontentment and his continual comparison between big and small companies was not helping him. Pandya asked him to take time develop the right perspective toward the business that he was now in and change his attitude. Later in November 2009 Mathur spoke arrogantly to a customer who had submitted a small order. This incident made Pandya realize that things were likely not working out with Mathur and he asked him to leave Eco Tasar for the best interests of the company and himself. Pandya said â€œYou should not be working for an organization where you look at it as a step down in your career.â€ Mathur left Eco Tasar in December 2009.Immediately thereafter on December 15 2009 Rahul Rai joined the company. He had previously worked for almost eight years at a mid-sized export house. Rai expressed a desire for more responsibilities and challenging assignments. Pandya saw in Rai a good candidate for the role of marketing. Rai too went through a carefully planned orientation schedule which allowed him time to understand the business and settle into his new position. Pandya familiarized Rai with the business philosophy the supply chain the designing and production processes and the clients in the market both current and prospective.Rai settled into his job and Pandya soon noticed that Rai was putting in long hours as he made concerted efforts to develop new clients and secure larger orders from the current clients. Rai made good progress which Pandya appreciated. However as time passed Rai began to show signs of poor motivation and frustration. He began to struggle to meet his own set marketing targets.One day during an informal gathering in the office Rai walked up to Pandya and shared: Things were so structured in my previous organization. Here one has to do many related tasks. There it was nice having a set job description and working only for a particular vertical. We didnâ€™t have to do other unnecessary tasks. Donâ€™t you think it is a sheer waste of time? In addition it is tough to convince customers. Here in the time that it takes to convince one customer in my previous organization I would have made three sales.Pandya thought that Rai was looking for a support system. It seemed as though Rai had not done any homework before joining Eco Tasar. Although his expectation of a pay increase had been met he never shared that he would be unable to work in a multitasking environment. This attitude was not acceptable to Pandya. Considering the companyâ€™s marketing targets and over the past two years Raiâ€™s limitations in achieving those targets Pandya decided to support him with another marketing professional. In February 2012 Ravish Ranjan joined Eco Tasar and was happy after the salary negotiation. He came from a company that was of similar size as Eco Tasar in terms of revenue and had a reasonably large market share in the domestic market. Pandya recalled that Ranjan had told him during the interview that he was stagnating in terms of his learning and development.Ranjan seemed to settle in well. He and Rai appeared to be a compatible and focused team. However seven months into his job Ranjan reflected his concerns: â€œAt other places you made huge sales in one go and earned attractive incentives whereas here you need to cater to individual consumers and end up selling only in small quantities. My patience is running out with such small orders.â€Pandya tried to explain the situation to Ranjan: â€œI think that is where your selling skill comes into the picture. Eco Tasar is thriving on boutique customers. You need to put in some effort to sell artisanal products with a story. It is never the same when you are selling stuff in bulk . . . the dynamics are different.â€ Ranjan was an entrepreneurial worker. He had no problems multitasking as was typically expected in such a set-up. Over time Ranjan would repeatedly suggest to Pandya that the business would do well to enter into the polyester business. On one occasion Ranjan said â€œPolyester sells like hot cakes. For polyester items you can sell 5000 pieces for $3 each whereas a similar piece in silk would sell for nothing less than $12.â€ To this comment Pandya replied â€œThatâ€™s where I differ. My enterprise stands for artisans. Eco Tasarâ€™s mandate was to create work for others through our work. I am quite clear that I would not switch over to any other model even at the cost of forgoing opportunities for huge profits.â€ Ranjan persisted: â€œI still suggest you reconsider this sales model. For me it is business first and then society. Sorry to say but Eco Tasar will find it very difficult to survive. You know getting into polyester . . . I will be able to bring in a lot of sales through my contacts from my previous organization.â€ Pandya tried to explain to Ranjan that he needed to rethink his sales strategy: It doesnâ€™t matter. You do not need to get that many customers. Try to hunt up and cater to the smaller ones who really prize handloom material. That is what Eco Tasar came into existence for. If the artisans put so much of effort into creating finery and magnificence in a piece then I think the salesperson also needs to go that extra mile and convince the customer to buy. However a switch from the current sales model is not remotely possible! A few months dragged on with poor sales; then on December 25 2013 Ranjan walked up to Pandya and said â€œI have tried my bit. Since I am on an incentive scheme it is difficult. It might be a very respected sales model but it is getting difficult for me to sustain. I can no longer continue unless you rethink the product.â€ Within a week of this conversation Ranjan left Eco Tasar.Pandya now felt that those who had experience in for-profit organizations were not suitable for working at Eco Tasar. He then considered seeking someone with experience in a not-for-profit organization. In February 2014 Pandya hired Binu Raj who had worked in an NGO that was involved in promoting cottage industries in the undeveloped areas of central India. During the interview Raj had exhibited a strong passion for working for social causes. Like he had for the others Pandya ensured a thorough orientation period for Raj.Raj settled into Eco Tasar well and was comfortable with the work. However over a period of time Pandya realized that sales targets did not seem to be Rajâ€™s primary focus. Although Raj enjoyed his trips to the villages where Eco Tasar sourced its yarn and was often promising the weavers better prospects his enthusiasm in the core production processes was not translating into a drive for sales. This situation however never seemed to perturb Raj. Pandya was happy that Raj had settled into the work and was not complaining about sales issues. However Pandya was also concerned that Raj was not able to drive up sales. Even more disturbing was the fact that Raj did not seem to be troubled by the often moderate-to-weak sales figures quarter after quarter. Pandyaâ€™s DilemmaPandya wondered â€œI have tried people with different backgrounds but all seemed to have failed in letting go of the baggage of their background. They were either unable to adjust to the values of the organization or did not understand the need for being sufficiently competitive to ensure sustainability.â€ While Pandya knew that demand existed for Eco Tasarâ€™s products he was not able to understand what had gone wrong with the marketing professionals. Pandya wondered whether he would be better off going back to the earlier arrangement wherein he ran the show himself with young graduates and trainees supporting him. Pandya continued to wonder what he should do to address the issue.Exhibit 1: ECo tasarâ€™s Consolidated Statements 2011â€“2016 (for year ending March 31)Note: â‚¹ = INR = Indian rupee; US$1.00 = â‚¹50.87 on March 31 2012; US$1.00 = â‚¹54.30 on March 31 2013; US$1.00 = â‚¹59.96 on March 31 2014; US$1.00 = â‚¹62.27 on March 31 2015; US$1.00 = â‚¹66.25 on March 31 2012.Source: Company files.Exhibit 2: ECO TASARâ€™S Aspirations 2020â€”Creating a Social and Market Impact by Leveraging TechnologySocial ImpactTouch at least 20000 producers by 2020.Target 25% of Eco Tasar sales to be allocated to wages.Cycle back profits of Eco Tasar for equitable distribution among all stakeholders.

Our goal is to publish materials of the highest quality; submit any errata to publishcases@ivey.ca. i1v2e5y5pubsCopyright Â© 2019 Ivey Business School Foundation	Version: 2019-05-17As Ruifen Yu founder and president of Laiyifen Company Limited (LYFEN) sat at her desk in her Shanghai office she began to prepare for her meeting the following week with Yonglei Shi the companyâ€™s chairman. It was Monday January 7 2019 and LYFEN had celebrated its eighteenth year of operation. A leading snack food chain brand in China LYFEN had achieved steady growth since its inception with record revenues of Â¥3.9 billion in 2018. Yu reflected on the current situation:LYFENâ€™s supplier management capabilities have contributed significantly to the companyâ€™s success. We treat suppliers as if they are part of the organization an approach that is unique to our industry. However we have high expectations. LYFEN provides a premium product and our suppliers are required to meet or exceed the current industry standards for quality and food safety without compromising cost or delivery performance. We also expect suppliers to work closely with us in areas such as new product development. LYFEN understands the important role that our suppliers play in supporting company growth going forward.The companyâ€™s strategy for 2019 included expansion into new regions and the introduction of new products. Initiatives were also underway to promote the companyâ€™s brand and explore new distribution channels such as online sales. During her meeting with Shi the following Wednesday Yu was planning to provide an update on LYFENâ€™s supplier management activities discuss opportunities for improvements and identify initiatives aimed at supporting the companyâ€™s strategic objectives. The Chinese Snack Food IndustrySnack foods offered consumers ready-to-eat small portions outside of regular meals. A shift in modes of food consumption as a result of greater mobility busy consumer life styles; and a desire for greater convenience contributed to the growth of the snack food market segment. Generally snack food products were classified into nine broad categories: nuts meat preserves cakes soy aquatic dried fruit and vegetables chocolate candies and puffed foods.The upstream industries in the supply chain included agriculture and aquaculture and food processing and packaging. Suppliers included large international brands such as General Mills Inc. PepsiCo Inc. and Mondelez International Inc. as well as small regional food processors ingredient manufacturers and distributors. Snack foods were sold to consumers through a variety of sales channels such as food stores supermarkets convenience stores vending machines and online shops.The snack food market in China was approximately Â¥485 billion in 2017 up from Â¥393 billion in 2013 (see Exhibit 1). Industry forecasts called for similar growth over the next five years. Rising consumer disposable income was cited as one factor contributing to the expansion of the Chinese snack food market. The industry had two notable features: First competition was intense and brand concentration was relatively low. Chinaâ€™s vast geographic territory contributed to a wide range of eating habits and preferences across the country. As a result many snack food companies had a regional presence specializing in a segment (e.g. flavour) within a snack food category (e.g. meat or nuts).  Second as spending on snack foods grew expectations for product quality were increasing. Consumers were looking for healthy alternatives and wanted to understand what was in the food how it came from the farm to the table and whether or not it was produced in a socially and environmentally responsible manner. Therefore supply chain transparency and traceability were becoming increasingly important. However few firms were able to adequately address these consumer expectations. For example a survey by the Beijing Bureau of Investigation of the National Bureau of Statistics found that the satisfaction level of urban residents in Beijing on the safety of snack food in 2017 was 70.6 per cent the lowest among all food categories. LYFENEstablished in 2002 LYFEN was one of the largest snack food retailers in China with annual revenues of nearly Â¥3.9 billion in 2018. It had nearly 2700 stores located in 19 provinces and employed more than 9000 people. The majority of LYFEN sales were through brick-and-mortar stores (company-owned and franchises) which accounted for approximately 85 per cent of 2018 revenues. In contrast online sales accounted for approximately 9 per cent of revenues. Exhibit 2 provides a summary of LYFENâ€™s financial results for fiscal years 2014â€“2018.With more than 1400 active stock keeping units (SKUs) LYFEN products included a wide variety of snack foods including roasted nuts dried meats and preserved fruits. Its brand symbolized snack foods that were â€œhealthy delicious fresh and high quality.â€ LYFEN snack foods were premium products that were sold at a higher price compared to the competition. LYFEN Initial Public Offering (IPO)In 2012 LYFEN prepared for its IPO on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. However five days after the company released its IPO prospectus China Central Television ran a story about questionable operational practices including unsanitary production operations and excessive food additives at one of LYFENâ€™s suppliers a firm that produced a preserved plum snack. Although the investigation by the Administration for Industry and Commerce was unable to substantiate the report LYFEN sales were negatively affected. On July 27 2012 the China Securities Regulatory Commission cancelled the LYFEN IPO. Following the incident the company management made significant changes to its supplier management processes placing increasing focus on controlling product quality and ensuring food safety from the origin (e.g. farmers) to the end consumer. LYFEN increased supplier certification and inspection standards; including tracing key raw materials from their origin from 2012. Yu explained:In the past 18 years LYFEN has been engraving â€œconscienceâ€ as emphasized in Chinese culture into corporate value. LYFEN always advocates that the food industry is a conscience business and an ethical industry. The realization of product quality ultimately depends on all the operators and producers. We issued our 3.0 strategy centred on love and happiness to help nearly 10000 employees develop better business ethics in 2018. We also strengthened the concept and value of high standards of business ethics in our supplier training which is an enhancement of artisan spirit. Although the 2012 report was unfounded it drove us to do more to ensure food safety. We paved the way for a â€œtransparent factoryâ€ for our consumers and the media. At the same time we introduced new technology from the United States to test the content of food additives. We want to make sure that LYFEN snacks are safe and healthy.LYFEN was listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange on October 12 2016 and became the first snack food company listed on the A-share main board issuing 60 million shares at an issue price of Â¥11.67. Exhibit 3 provides information on LYFENâ€™s stock prices.LYFEN Supply ChainThe selection and management of suppliers was the combined responsibility of the product development centre the supplier management department and the quality management department. LYFEN had more than 200 suppliers with 15 per cent accounting for about 50 per cent of the total value of purchases and 40 per cent accounting for about 80 per cent of the total value of purchases. Supplier selection was handled by the procurement department which worked with existing and potential suppliers for the development of new products. This group handled the commercial arrangements with suppliers including contracting and pricing. The supplier management department was responsible for the day-to-day supplier relationship management activities.New suppliers were carefully evaluated before being approved. The process began with a preliminary reviewâ€”with the supplier completing a self-assessmentâ€”and testing of product samples. The self-assessment included a review of the companyâ€™s quality systems business licenses and production operations. Provided that the self-assessment satisfied LYFENâ€™s requirements a production site assessment was conducted which involved a thorough evaluation of the supplierâ€™s food safety processes production operations; health and safety practices and inventory management practices. An important part of the supplier selection process included an assessment of the alignment of organization cultures as described by Yu:Alignment of corporate cultures is an essential when choosing a new supplier. We have a great deal of ongoing contact with our suppliers at all levels of the organization including top management managers and cross-functional project teams. A good working relationship anchored in share values is critical. These values include a dedication to food safety and product quality.LYFEN actively managed multiple tiers of the supply chain. Raw material specifications and sources of supply were set by LYFEN for its suppliers and documented in the material control list. The companyâ€™s objective was to control product quality from origin to final sale.Supplier Relationship ManagementSupplier relationship management activities involved multiple layers of engagement. First each supplier was audited by LYFEN annually and more than half of the suppliers were audited twice per year. The LYFEN supplier audit was based on the principles of ISO 9001 ISO 22000 and the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points food safety management system. These audits focused on quality management systemsâ€”including food safetyâ€”and also included a comprehensive review of management practices in areas such as supply-chain management production operations and health and safety. Second LYFEN supplemented supplier audits with other methods of supplier monitoring including independent third-party audits real-time video surveillance of supplier facilities and flight inspections. Third an important element of LYFENâ€™s supplier-relationship management practices was supplier training. ChengPeng Zhao the supplier management department manager explained the companyâ€™s approach to supplier training:Most of our key suppliers have been with us for more than 10 years. More than 10 years ago many suppliers started as small companies with only a few employees and have grown considerably as LYFEN expanded. We work closely with suppliers to simultaneously improve quality and food safety reduce costs and increase capacity to keep up with our growth. This involves two levels. First to achieve LYFENâ€™s objective of world-class quality and food safety standards we benchmark food companies on a global basis. To demonstrate best practices to senior management at our supplier companies we organize plant visits with groups of executives from our supplier community to food manufacturers in locations such as Japan and South Korea to show what is possible to achieve. We organize six or seven such events each year. It is important that our suppliers do not get complacent. For example one of our key suppliers has set a target for this year to increase capacity by 10 per cent while reducing costs by 25 per cent through process improvements and investments in automation and without compromising quality or safety. The second aspect of supplier training is operational. We help suppliers develop programs to improve their quality management and supply chain systems including running workshops to train employees in areas such as quality control and food safety. For suppliers who require working capital to fund improvements in their operations and quality systems we help by providing early payment terms.In the course of our 18 years of development LYFEN has promoted the continuous improvement of the snack food industry by formulating standards that are higher than national standards and establishing a â€œhealth industry community.â€ Mrs. Yu was selected by the China Food Industry Association as a recipient of an entrepreneurship award at a ceremony to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Chinaâ€™s reform and opening-up.Quality ManagementIn order to ensure maximum quality LYFEN created 24 measures to ensure food safety. Each incoming shipment to LYFEN distribution centres included supplier quality control reports that were reviewed by the quality management department. Using random sampling two types of inspections were performed: visual and chemical. Visual inspection included examining labelling packaging size and colour and food taste. Chemical inspection tested for potential contaminants to ensure food safety and quality.In 2017 LYFEN started an initiative in which product packaging included a quick response (QR) code that customers could scan with their cell phones in the store to provide access to product information. This information included the name and location of the supplier when the product was produced when it was shipped from the supplier to LYFEN when it was delivered to the store and the expiry date (see Exhibit 4). The QR code also provided the customer with access to a real-time video of the supplier plant operation that allowed the customer to see how the product was manufactured including the working conditions within the plant (see Exhibit 5). Zhao commented on the objectives of this initiative:We want to provide the customer with transparency to our product quality including how and where it was produced. The ability to see the supplier plants allows us to showcase our suppliersâ€™ operations and reinforce to the consumer that LYFEN sells only products of very high quality. I am confident that many of our competitors would not want to share this information about their supply chain. Today this QR code technology is used on about two-thirds of our SKUs and we expect to have it available for 80 per cent of our SKUs by the end of 2019.CompetitionAs the builder of a Chinese snack food chain business model LYFEN had two main competitorsâ€”Three Squirrels and Bestore. In recent years the two companies had grown rapidly supported by the development of the Chinese e-commerce market and were accelerating their IPOs. Exhibit 2 provides financial information on these companies and Exhibit 6 shows prices for nine products from LYFEN Three Squirrels and Bestore.Three SquirrelsFounded in 2012 Three Squirrels was an online retailer selling products through a variety of online platforms such as Tmall.com and Alibaba.com that accounted for more than 50 per cent of its total sales. Three Squirrels used a series of supplier-management and quality control measures including assessment of new suppliers and including a preliminary qualification review on-site audit and integrity assessment. Three Squirrels provided training to existing suppliers on delivery processes and the operation of the companyâ€™s information platform. The company conducted at least one routine and one unscheduled supplier inspection each year and used real-time video surveillance at key production facilities of major suppliers. Three Squirrels also conducted sample testing for each batch of products wherein unqualified products were returned.BestoreBestore opened its first store in Wuhan Hubei Province on August 28 2006. Its product range included meat products nuts candies instant food and other varieties. The sales channels of Bestore included company-owned stores franchise stores and online shops. In 2018 online revenue accounted for approximately 40 per cent of sales. Bestore developed the â€œSupplier Introduction Processâ€ which described its supplier screening process. The companyâ€™s quality management centre conducted regular and random supplier evaluations including inflight evaluations. The receiving inspection process involved sample testing of the products and unqualified products were returned.Preparing for the MeetingAs Yu prepared for her meeting with Shi she contemplated the opportunities for LYFEN:Most of our competitors focus on brand management. In contrast supply chain management is a core competency at LYFEN that we feel provides a competitive advantage. Our attention to quality and food safety is a key differentiator and we are able to use information technology to help demonstrate the product quality to our customers.We have plans to grow LYFEN to 10000 retail locations over the next five years which will include expanding our number of distribution channels and the geographic footprint to cover the entire country. This will put pressure on our suppliers to maintain quality and delivery performance while simultaneously increasing capacity. This growth should provide greater purchasing power and economies of scale enabling us to reduce costs. Our success has also been our suppliersâ€™ successâ€”it is like a commonwealth where we treat them as part of our organization. During the meeting next week we need to discuss our priorities going forward and opportunities for the supply chain organization to support LYFENâ€™s strategic objectives.Exhibit 1: Growth in the Chinese Snack Food MarketSource: â€œReport on the Market Competition Pattern and Future Development trend of Chinaâ€™s Snack Food Industry in 2018â€“2024â€ Zhiyan Consulting Group May 2018 accessed January 7 2019 www.chyxx.com/research/201805/641975.html.Exhibit 2: Key Financial Information for LYFEN Three Squirrels and Bestore(In Millions Â¥)Sources: Laiyifen Co.

Our goal is to publish materials of the highest quality; submit any errata to publishcases@ivey.ca. i1v2e5y5pubsCopyright Â© 2019 Ivey Business School Foundation	Version: 2019-07-25â€œAnd what are your expectations when it comes to compensation?â€ Jeff Arvidson president of Cisca Engineering Ltd. (CEL) had posed this question hoping that Ron Grubb the candidate he was interviewing would give a reasonable number. This was someone he wanted to be able to afford.Grubb was being interviewed for a position as a mechanical engineerâ€”specifically as a pipe stress analyst. This was a line of work that CEL was looking to add to its professional services repertoire. Both Arvidson and engineering manager Bob Davies who was also part of the interviewing team were pretty much convincedâ€”not only that Grubb had the technical skills they needed but also that he would be a good fit for the culture at CEL.After pausing for a moment Grubb looked confidently at both interviewers in turn and answered â€œWell based on my seven years of engineering experience as well as the unique set of skills that I bring to the table I would expect my salary to be in at least the CA$90000 to $110000 range.â€Putting his head down to make a note on Grubbâ€™s resumÃ© Arvidson tried to hide his disappointment. The amount was significantly higher than he had hoped. Uncertain of how to deal with the issue he decided to push it off and he responded â€œWell that is more than most engineers usually start out at here but letâ€™s put off the compensation discussion until after we finish assessing your fit for this role.â€ Arvidson then sat back and allowed Davies to lead the remainder of the interview.Arvidsonâ€™s mind started to distance itself from the conversation going on in front of him and focussed instead on what it would take to get Grubb or someone like him to accept an offer at CEL. Arvidson felt that as a smaller employer his organization sometimes had difficulty attracting the critical people it needed to continue to grow. He knew that the work environment the people and the interesting projects they worked on were strong selling pointsâ€”but there was no denying that sometimes the compensation levels lagged behind those at larger firms and money was important to people. After hearing Grubbâ€™s salary expectations he knew that something was going to have to give. He was tempted to simply do whatever it took to convince Grubb to join even if that meant paying him a lot more than most of the other engineers received. However Arvidson knew enough to be mindful of how such a decision could affect the other employees in the company.CEL BackgroundCEL was a Canadian engineering consulting firm located in Waterloo Ontario. It provided customers throughout the world with services related to the manufacturing of pressure equipment. Pressure vessels were containers that held liquids or gases at pressures that differed from regular conditions. Since the material was being held under pressure the containers could potentially explode hurting anyone nearby. Due to this danger each country carefully regulated the manufacturing and operation of pressure vessels. No one in Canada could legally use a pressure vessel unless it had been proven to meet the high standards set by the government. Organizations from other countries that wanted to sell pressure vessels in Canada also had to have an engineering firm certify that the containers met Canadian regulations. This is where CEL came in. The company had the engineering qualifications necessary to provide this certification to customers in a number of industries including oil and gas water filtration food and beverage instrumentation and pharmaceuticals.Founded in 1999 by Cheryl Landsberg CEL had 16 employees in 2018. When Landsberg retired in 2017 she had maintained a 20 per cent share in the company and arranged for employees to take ownership of the rest. This meant that a majority of CELâ€™s employees had about 5 per cent stakes in their employer. Employees were able to purchase shares at 10 per cent of fair market value. To make it easy for employees to be involved the company had arranged a plan that enabled them to purchase shares over time as dividends accrued. In this way employees were able to become minority owners without much personal cash outlay.To continue to grow the business after it became employee-owned Arvidson and the board of directors had decided to branch out into pipe stress analysis which was related to the work CEL traditionally performed. CEL clients often needed this type of work but since CEL did not have the necessary resources it had always passed this work on to another engineering firm. Arvidson was tired of forgoing the opportunity for increased revenue and he also wanted to better serve the firmâ€™s clients so he knew it was time to hire someone with these skills.Compensation DataAfter the interview was over and Grubb had been shown out Arvidson and Davies remained in the conference room to discuss their impressions. They agreed that Grubb was someone they wanted to add to their team; however they couldnâ€™t ignore the issue of compensation.Davies said I saw the look on your face when he said he wanted 90 to 110 grand. Now Jeff I know thatâ€™s more than some of our other engineers make but we really need this guy. Right now we are farming out all of our pipe stress work. If Grubb was on board we could keep it in house. Heâ€™ll pay for himself in no time. Plus he will help to strengthen the company by giving us a whole new skill set to offer our customers.Arvidson shrugged and replied â€œI know what youâ€™re saying Bob. Iâ€™d like to have him here too. But we have to be careful. If we pay him more than we pay the other engineers how is that going to make the others feel? We may end up with one happy employee and half a dozen unhappy ones.â€Sifting through a folder in front of him Arvidson remarked â€œIâ€™ve pulled some data.â€ He handed Davies a sheet of paper (see Exhibit 1). â€œThis is some information on what we pay our engineers currently. If we stayed consistent with this based on Grubbâ€™s experience we would have to offer him a starting salary of about $85000.â€As Davies started to review the page Arvidson pulled out another sheet and passed it over (see Exhibit 2) saying I almost forgot I also pulled some salary survey data from a couple of sources. That first sheet will help us figure out how to pay fairly within the company. This second one will tell us how to ensure our employees are being compensated fairly compared with people in other companies who are in mid-level engineering roles.Arvidson added â€œI think the dividends aspect will end up being a game-changer when it comes to compensation. Our base salaries are not as high as they could be but the dividends could end up being a real windfall at some point.â€ Davies replied I love that we as employees own the company now and the way you set it up to let everyone be involved was a great idea. I know that we wonâ€™t get much in terms of dividends in the first few years because the profits will go to pay for our shares but after that we could get a dividend of between 30 and 40 per cent of our earnings in a good year. Thatâ€™s a big deal!Arvidson sat back in his chair with a sombre expression; then he continued: Between you and me Iâ€™ve heard some grumbling from a couple of employees that they would rather have a higher base salary than live with the uncertainty of dividends that are dependent on firm performance. It is hard for them to see that as owners they have to accept the risk along with the potential for reward. They have to understand that this set-up will make us stronger over the long term because we wonâ€™t have super-high compensation costs in the bad years. Iâ€™ve seen some companies go under because of that.Davies smiled as he replied: â€œI guess itâ€™s hard to see the big picture when you are hoping to buy a new big-screen TV right away.â€ Arvidson shook his head and chuckled. He saidWell youâ€™ve got me there. I just wish they would remember that money isnâ€™t everything. We do well by employees in other ways too. As you know there are lots of other benefits associated with working here. We have good holidays a great environment help with training and the list goes on.Nodding Davies agreed: â€œThatâ€™s for sure. Hey speaking of lists donâ€™t you send employees a sheet reminding them of everything they get?â€ Pleased at the reminder Arvidson stood up. â€œYouâ€™re right. Good thinking!â€ he said. â€œWe do send out a total rewards statement every year. That could help this discussion. Let me go and get a copy.â€ He left the room returning a few minutes later with two printouts. Handing one to Davies he said â€œHere is a sample statement that was the starting template for the last one. This goes out every April. I printed a copy for each of usâ€ (see Exhibit 3).Perusing the document Davies remarked â€œThere are a lot of different things on here. It really adds up doesnâ€™t it?â€ Nodding Arvidson replied â€œIt sure does. We started doing this to help employees get an idea of all the things CEL provides. Iâ€™m always worried about employees leaving so I thought this would help them to see that weâ€™re doing right by them.â€A phone buzzed and both men looked at their screens. Davies said to Arvidson â€œThatâ€™s me. Sorry but I have to go. Can we finish this conversation tomorrow?â€ Arvidson nodded and collected his papers. As he stood he said â€œSure. We donâ€™t have to decide anything today. Iâ€™d like to collect some more data anyway.â€ Together they walked out of the conference room and each headed off in a different direction.The Employee PerspectiveWanting to obtain some employee input Arvidson spent the next couple of hours walking around and chatting informally with his employees about compensation and rewards. Unsurprisingly he found that their opinions were varied. Some thought that money mattered most but many others on the team put more value on the lifestyle aspects of the reward system. The latter group valued flex time the collegial working environment the weekly barbecues and so on. One employee noted that she wanted a higher salary but commented at the same time that another employer â€œcouldnâ€™t offer anything to make me want to leave.â€ When he asked what stood out to them on their total rewards statement only a few employees could remember the details in the document. Reading between the lines Arvidson realized that they reviewed it when it came in but then mostly forgot about it. He began to worry that while the statement had a lot of good information it might not have enough impact. Decision TimeBack in his office with time to review his thoughts Arvidson sketched out his three main options on a pad of paper and pondered what to do. Should he offer Grubb the job at a lower salary and take the chance of being turned down? Should he give Grubb the salary he wanted and risk upsetting his other employees if they found out? Should he completely revamp his compensation system and increase salary levels for all of the engineers?He wasnâ€™t sure which option was the best choice.Exhibit 1: Average Base Pay for Current Employees at CEL (in $CA)Average base pay for engineers with less than five yearsâ€™ experience: $78000Average base pay for engineers with between five and 10 yearsâ€™ experience: $85000Average base pay for engineers with between 10 and 15 yearsâ€™ experience: $96000Source: Company files.Exhibit 2: 2017 Salary Survey Data from Professional Associationsâ€”Intermediate Engineering Position (in $CA)Source: Created by the case authors based on the data for Salary Survey 1 which came from a 2017 report from Randstad and the data for Salary Survey 2 which came from a 2017 report from the Ontario Society of Professional Engineers (OPSE).Exhibit 3: CEL Total Rewards StatementSAMPLEâ€”Communicating the Value of Your Total RewardsYour 2016 Personalized Total Rewards StatementDATE/MONTH/YEARDear (Employee Name)In February you received your 2016 T4 statement which summarized the compensation you earned as a member of the Cisca Engineering team this past calendar year.

There is not enough marginin the payment business for the wallets to have a future.â€Aditya Puri managing director and chief executive officer of HDFC Bank LimitedAditya Puriâ€™s opinion about the digital wallet (also called â€œmobile walletâ€ or â€œe-walletâ€) business model set up an interesting question about the future of Paytm Payments Bank Limited (Paytm) the leader in the e-wallet business in India which had reported a loss of more than â‚¹15485 million for financial year (FY) 2015â€“16. The question became even more significant when Paytm started its long-awaited payments bank operation the third of its kind in India on May 23 2017. Interestingly less than two months after its launch Vijay Shekhar Sharma founder and chief executive officer (CEO) of Paytm said â€œIn the next three years weâ€™re going to be bigger than the biggest traditional bank in India.â€ In May 2017 Paytm had been valued at US$7 billion making it the second-most-valuable start-up in India. Despite Sharmaâ€™s optimism about the future of Paytmâ€™s new venture Indiaâ€™s central banking institution the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) expressed serious concerns about the existing health of the countryâ€™s banking system. India had witnessed two major developments that it was still struggling to come to terms with: a demonetization exercise in November 2016 and the introduction of the uniform Goods and Services Tax (GST) on July 1 2017. Both these efforts were directed toward controlling Indiaâ€™s informal economy (unorganized sectors) and tax evasion. Overall the countryâ€™s economy was causing further concerns; its growth rate had slowed to 6.1 per cent in the last quarter of FY 2016â€“17 (compared to 7 per cent in the preceding quarter). Even though the central government expected a recovered growth rate of 6.75â€“7.5 per cent for FY 2017â€“18 the slowdown raised doubts about the viability and sustainability of the online payments industry in which Paytm was a major player. In the highly competitive and crowded banking sector in India could Paytm create a strong position for itself? What were its plans for survival and growth in the future? Had Indiaâ€™s demonetization exercise created short-term temporary gains or long-term sustainable gains for firms like Paytm? Now in 2017 would Sharma be able to steer Paytm toward continued success in Indiaâ€™s complex business landscape? COMPANY OVERVIEWSharma born in 1973 founded Paytmâ€™s parent companyâ€”One97 Communications Limited (One97) Indiaâ€™s leading mobile Internet company which owned the flagship brand Paytmâ€”in 2000. In its initial days One97 offered live astrology services for a global system for a mobile operator in Delhi. One97 successively provided many more value-added services to mobile phone subscribers such as SMS-based applications and businesses music messaging voice-based gaming subscription-based content services ringtones recharge services and many more service offerings including the launch of Paytm Indiaâ€™s biggest online mobile recharge portal. Paytm Mobile Solutions Private Limited incorporated in 2009 was primarily engaged in the business of managing a mobile commerce platform. Headquartered in New Delhi One97 had more than 4500 employees; regional offices in Mumbai Bengaluru Pune Chennai and Kolkata; and a global presence in Africa Europe the Middle East and Southeast Asia. The firm was backed by marquee investors like Alibaba Group Holding Limited (Alibaba) Ant Financial Services Group (AliPay) SAIF Partners MediaTek Inc. Sapphire Ventures and Silicon Valley Bank. Further in the second quarter of 2017 in an otherwise financially tight market Sharma was able to raise US$1.4 billion as equity infusion from SoftBank Group Corp. However recovering from the â‚¹15485 million loss posted by Paytm in FY 2015â€“16 was a daunting challenge for Sharma and his team (see Exhibit 1). Like many value-added service providers Paytm used a simple technology-enabled mobile payment model to earn service charges that were based on a percentage of the value of transactions. Other sources of revenue for the company included commission income from mobile recharges and payments of utility bills and one time set-up fees charged to merchants. This payments business model was volume driven and had narrow margins. One97 operated through the single brand name â€œPaytmâ€ which was used initially for the companyâ€™s e-wallet business. The company next ventured into e-commerce (â€œmarketplaceâ€ model) business through the same brand and floated it as Paytm E-Commerce Private Limited in 2016 which ran the â€œPaytm Mall.â€ The latest foray had been to enter the payments bank business through its subsidiary Paytm (see Exhibit 2).DEMONETIZATION: a â€œGAME CHANGERâ€ FOR the INDIAN MOBILE PAYMENTS INDUSTRYThe Indian governmentâ€™s emphasis on digitization with financial inclusion (in the form of initiatives like the â€œPrime Ministerâ€™s People Money Schemeâ€ and the use of unique identification numbers for every citizen (known as the Aadhar Project)) was a game-changing factor for established players like Paytm. In an emergency address to the nation aired through national television on the evening of November 8 2016 Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared that â‚¹500 and â‚¹1000 currency notes would become void from midnight on that date. Modi added that â‚¹1000 notes would be permanently withdrawn from circulation and â‚¹500 notes would be replaced in the following few weeks while â‚¹2000 notes would be introduced shortly. People were given until December 30 2016 to deposit the banned currency notes in their bank and post office accounts. According to expert estimates the November 8th announcement rendered 86 per cent of Indian currency null and void.The Indian government promoted this radical initiative as a major step toward addressing and minimizing corruption and illegal transactions (or â€œblack moneyâ€) in the Indian economy. Nearly 98 per cent of all economic transactions in India (by volume) were in cash. The cash in circulation to gross domestic product ratio in India was 11.8 per cent in 2015 compared to 8.7 per cent in Germany 3.8 per cent in Brazil and in Canada and 4 per cent in Australia. The governmentâ€™s initiative was targeted at increasing Indiaâ€™s progress toward becoming a cashless economy which it saw as a hallmark of more developed countries. In the weeks following November 8th people in every part of India faced significant difficulties in withdrawing their money from banks. Long queues outside automated teller machines (ATMs) were a common sight throughout the country especially in large cities. Because of the severe cash crunch both individuals and businesses had difficulty carrying out transactions even as the government encouraged Indian consumers to move forward with more â€œcashlessâ€ transactions. Paytm Seizes an OpportunityAlthough the push for demonetization brought a general surge in digital modes of payment in India (see Exhibit 3) as a leader in the mobile payments business Paytm was one of the biggest benefactors of this initiative. The company immediately used the opportunity to pursue an extensive advertisement campaign. Small businesses shop owners cab drivers and many other vendors started accepting payments through Paytmâ€™s mobile application (app).Many online payment service providers praised Indiaâ€™s government for its bold move. Among them was Paytmâ€™s chief financial officer Madhur Deora who said â€œThis is the biggest and most ambitious step ever to crack down on black money and fake currency. We stand by the government in its efforts towards taking black money out of the equation and offering a major boost to the Indian economy.â€ He added â€œSince Paytm is fast becoming synonymous to all kinds of payments we are happy to announce we have registered a strong surge in volume on our platform.â€  Within hours of the demonetization announcement Paytm experienced a 435 per cent increase in its overall traffic a 200 per cent rise in the number of app downloads a 250 per cent increase in the number and value of overall transactions a 400 per cent rise in offline payments based on transaction value a 30 per cent surge in the number of saved cards and a 1000 per cent increase in money added to e-wallets on the companyâ€™s platform.Within a week of the demonetization declaration Paytm released another set of promising numbers indicating a massive growth in business: â€œPaytm has touched a record 5 million transactions a day . . . and is on the way to process over [â‚¹240 billion] (by March 2017) more than any other payment network in the country.â€ The company reported that its offline payment solutions offering was garnering support from offline merchants and that it had signed up with more than 850000 entities allowing cabs petrol pumps and restaurants (among others across the country) to accept e-wallet-based payments. Further Paytm noted that it had set an aggressive merchant acquisition target of 5 million merchants by the end of FY 2016â€“17. The firmâ€™s name was fast becoming the new â€œbuzzwordâ€ in India.To curb black money and limit cash transactions the Government of India had set an ambitious target of 25 billion digital transactions in FY 2018â€”up from the 9.1 billion such transactions recorded in FY 2016â€“2017â€”and expected all Indian banks to transition to digital payments by 2018. The managing director and CEO of National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) remarked â€œAlmost all banks have tied up with NPCI. Our idea is to cover all banksâ€”even the cooperative banksâ€”within a year say by March 2018. All banks in the country will be a part of the digital payments system.â€the MOBILE WALLET INDUSTRYThe revolution in the mobile phone industry had yet to occur in India and the countryâ€™s mobile communications industry was at a relatively early stage. Mobile wallets (as opposed to traditional banking-based payments) were a recent development in India (see Exhibit 4) but e-wallet transactions in India had grown approximately 20 per cent between FY 2012â€“13 and FY 2015â€“16. Indiaâ€™s mobile subscription base had crossed the 1.2 billion mark in January 2017 and was projected to cross 1.4 billion by 2022. Further the country had around 330 million Internet users by the end of 2015 a figure that was expected to experience a 20 per cent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next five years. In this context Sandeep Kataria directorâ€“commercial of Vodafone India said â€œWe are democratizing data by making it more affordable and accessible. This is a key to driving usage and encouraging first-time users to come online . . . [facilitating] faster adoption of data and its better usage.â€ Digital disruptions had seen many Indian e-commerce businesses change their business models or fail quickly and e-wallet businesses in the digital service space had yet to find their feet in India. M-payment services offered a low-cost means to create financial access and use of these services was largely driven by the increase in smartphone users low mobile tariffs affordable handsets and increased Internet penetration. However this space was witnessing severe competition with many players entering the industry (see Exhibit 5).Paytmâ€™s Journey from E-Wallet Services to a Registered Payment BankIn December 2014 for the first time in Indiaâ€™s banking history RBI conceptualized a new discipline of banks with a view to push financial inclusion in the country: payment banks. RBIâ€™s objective was to bring the unbanked population of India to the formal banking channel. Payment banks were expected to leverage the rising use of mobile phone technology to target Indiaâ€™s migrant labourers low-income households and small businesses offering savings accounts and remittance services with low transaction costs. Forty-one applicants scrambled to gain â€œin-principleâ€ approval licences from RBI. In August 2015 eleven of these eligible applicants were granted appropriate licences (see Exhibit 6).On November 23 2016 fifteen days after demonetization Airtel Payments Bank Limited a subsidiary of Bharti Airtel Limited (Airtel) was the first to launch its pilot payment bank in the state of Rajasthan with an ambitious target of a full-scale launch across India in the near futureâ€”leaving Paytm to catch up. In addition to competition from established banking and financial players (e.g. scheduled commercial banks small finance banks microfinance banks non-banking finance companies co-operative finance companies and other financial technology firms) Paytm also faced competition from a well-networked India Post and established telecommunications players. The competition was further intensified as Airtel Payments Bank offered interest rates of up to 7.25 per cent on savings accounts to attract customers.Many industry titans believed payment banks represented a new breed of digital transactions that could only survive if low operating cost strategies were pursued. Aman Bhargava director (financial services advisory) at Grant Thornton India LLP stated:This [the use of digital transactions] calls for a new banking paradigm. The basic tenets for a successful payment bank call for high quality low cost of delivery regular education and incentivization of customers to make cashless transactions a part of their daily spending habits and a robust technological framework. Essentially the cost of transactions for a payment bank needs to be significantly lower (1/10th) of a traditional branch-based banking model paradigm. Many of the payment bank licence holders had also tied up with banks as their business correspondents. Business correspondents could carry out a range of services and transactions on behalf of banks for a wider consumer base receiving a commission for these services. Despite the fundamental business analysis three of the 11 payment bank licence holdersâ€”Tech Mahindra Limited Cholamandalam Distribution Services Limited and Consortium of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (promoted by Dilip Shanghvi IDFC Bank Limited and Telenor Financial Services)â€”dropped out of the game in the first half of 2016. Some industry stalwarts like State Bank of Indiaâ€™s CEO Arundhati Bhattacharya felt that the payment bank business model was the core problem:[By] design payment banks donâ€™t have a business model. . . . There is a big challenge on customer acquisition. Why would someone who is using a mobile banking service that is readily available be willing to migrate to a new [payment] bank? This too given that technology such as a unified payments system would enable cheaper transactions through mobile phones. Others argued that this fallout could be attributed to a lack of proper assessment when institutions applied for the banking licences or the fact that RBIâ€™s guidelines were too strict (see Exhibit 7). As one of the 11 payment bank licence holders could Paytm succeed and make money in a rather tight market that already contained established players? What strategy should Paytm pursue in order to build a sustainable business in this market? Challenges and Expectations The main challenge that payment banks faced was the general preference for cash transactions among Indian consumers. The penetration of debit and credit cards was very low in the country with 32.65 million credit cards and 810.87 million debit cards outstanding at the end of August 2017. Debit cards were primarily used to withdraw cash from ATMsâ€”this activity accounted for nearly 87 per cent of the total value of debit card transactions in August 2017â€”and were seldom used for online transactions. In addition to the strong cash-based culture in India other crucial challenges that payment banks in India faced included (1) acquiring and inducing potential customers with innovative product offerings while competing with the existing business correspondents and other competitors; (2) finding qualified people who could lead and operate payment banks in India (an untested business model so far in the country); (3) finding patient long-term investors; and (4) meeting the strict regulations regarding capital adequacy and risk exposures. An article in the Economic Times reported that Paytmâ€™s payments banking operations had incurred losses of â‚¹307 million between August 2016 and March 2017. In the same period the company only managed to earn revenues of â‚¹24.7 million. Yet according to another article in the Business Standard Paytm did not consider the â‚¹307 million a loss but looked at it as operational costs because the costs had occurred before the payments bank started its â€œrealâ€ operations in May 2017. Paytm began operations with its first payment bank branch in Noida Uttar Pradesh in May 2017. Eventually it planned to expand its footprint beyond metro and urban areas and to reach out to semi-urban as well as rural areas. By the end of its first year of operation Paytm had proposed to establish 31 branches 33 controlling offices and 3000 access points and to engage about 100000 banking correspondents to target 200 million e-wallet current and savings accounts. To support this expansion phase Sharma (along with One97) had invested a further â‚¹600 million. Their earlier investment in payments bank operations stood at â‚¹2.2 billion. Sounding optimistic about the firmâ€™s business prospects Renu Satti CEO of Paytm Payments Bank said â€œLeveraging the power of technology we aim to become the preferred bank for 500 million [customers] by 2020.â€PAYTMâ€™S ENTRY INTO THE E-COMMERCE SPACE Even as it attempted to succeed as a payments bank Paytm was also trying to establish itself as one of the major players in the Indian e-commerce market. The majority of this market (in the multi-product category) was occupied by e-commerce giants Flipkart and Amazon India; another prominent player in the market was Jasper Infotech Private Limited (operating under the name Snapdeal). Although the e-commerce industry had generated significant excitement at one time and was projected to reach US$100 billion in value by 2020 it had witnessed a massive slowdown in growth in 2016 when it grew just 12 per cent (as compared to 180 per cent growth in 2015). One study reported that in order to reach the projected goal for 2020 the industry would need to grow at a 45 per cent CAGR. The sudden slowdown was attributed to various internal and external factors.On March 31 2017 Paytm Mall reported a loss of â‚¹136.3 million and sales of â‚¹73.5 million. That arm of the business had been started in August 2016 after raising funds mainly from investor Alibaba. Paytm was relying on its innovative online-to-offline business model to emerge as a strong player in the e-commerce market. This model allowed customers to take advantage of online discounts in offline stores. Orders for the products were serviced from local brands and stores which entered into tie-ups with Paytm Mall offering significant advantages in terms of logistics and warehousing; at the same time the local brands and shops benefited from exposure on Paytm Mallâ€™s platform. This online-to-offline model had shown reasonable traction already as reported by several sources. In the future Paytm Mall planned to focus on the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) segment where it was hoping to achieve growth of 600 per cent and to invest â‚¹500 million on sales training marketing campaigns and supply chains. To cash in on the festive season of Diwali in India Paytm Mall offered an estimated â‚¹5.01 billion in cashback rewards; for example the company offered a discount of â‚¹15000 on the iPhone8 and the iPhone8 Plus. While these deep discounts would clearly result in losses the company was looking at them from a long-term perspective and hoped to recoup the discounts in increased sales. Amit Sinha chief operating officer at Paytm Mall said â€œAt present less than 1 per cent of total FMCG sales in India take place online . . . which offers [us a] unique opportunity. We want to be the platform our consumers use to shop [for] daily needs.â€Stretched too thin?Many observers wondered whether Paytm was simultaneously entering too many businesses and stretching its resources too thin. Even as Sharma exuded confidence about successfully leading the company to its next stage of growth questions remained about whether it was a realistic target to achieve growth in all three of Paytmâ€™s major businesses (e-wallet payments bank and e-commerce). As Paytm planned to expand its customer base fivefold from 120 million (reported in June 2016) and emerge as a serious challenger to Amazon and Flipkart in the e-commerce business it was working on recruiting top talent from premier engineering and management institutions in India. In an interview with the Economic Times Sharma commented:We plan to invest [â‚¹100 billion] over the next three to five years towards our commitment to promoting financial inclusion and enabling half-a-billion Indians to join the mainstream economy. We have to do a good job of tech and distribution to make it possible. We donâ€™t have to fight with banks to win. We are in nearly a blue ocean when we see our target customers and businesses. Traditional banks and financial institutions are complementary and partners in our business.Further Paytm had made many investments to support early-stage start-up ventures such as auto-rickshaw service aggregators hyperlocal delivery firm Jugnoo Delhi-based consumer behaviour prediction platform Shifu local services start-up Near.in online-to-offline deals start-up Little a consumer lifestyle deals marketplace logistics management company LogiNext and online ticketing and events platform Insider.in among others. Its most recent investment was QorQl an online start-up in the health care segment.Cash transactions dramatically decreased following the demonetization exercise and the digital payments industry saw increased consolidation. The future of the e-wallet and payments bank industry remained unknown and it was unlikely that all the existing players would thrive. Paytm needed to make smart decisions in this rapidly evolving business space. Against strong competitors and an uncertain environment how could Sharma and his team improve Paytmâ€™s performance and maintain its success?Exhibit 1: Financial Information for One97 Communications Limited 2009â€“2016Note: PAT = profit after tax; sales and profit after tax are shown on the primary axis and total asset balance is shown on the secondary axis.Source: Created by the case authors based on One97 Communications Limitedâ€™s financial data for FYs 2009 to 2016 obtained from Prowess Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy accessed November 12 2017 https://www.cmie.com.Exhibit 2: COMPANIES OPERATING UNDER SINGLE BRAND NAME â€œPAYTMâ€Source: Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) Government of India MCA Services Company name Lookup database Accessed March 02 2018 http://mca.gov.in/mcafoportal/viewCompanyMasterData.doExhibit 3: Post-DemonetiZation Growth in Digital Modes of Payments Note: Volume is in millions of transactions; value is in â‚¹ billions; *PPI issued by eight non-bank issuers for goods and services transactions only.Source: Created by the case authors based on Reserve Bank of India Macroeconomic Impact of Demonetisation: A Preliminary Assessment (March 10 2017) 40 accessed October 15 2017 https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/Publications/PDFs/MID10031760E85BDAFEFD497193995BB1B6DBE602.PDF.Exhibit 4: Non-Cash Payment Transactions IN INDIA FY 2016â€“17 (%) Note: RTGS = real-time gross settlement; CCIL = Corporation of India Limited; â€œOthersâ€ includes national electronic funds transfer mobile banking and prepaid instruments.

(iQmetrix) was about to unveil the data from a recent employee survey that asked employees about their perceptions of holacracy a new organizational design the company had adopted about one and a half years earlier. Headquartered in Vancouver BC Canada iQmetrix a software development company had grown rapidly since its founding in Regina Saskatchewan in 2001. Founded by brothers Christopher and Greg Krywulak iQmetrix was built on the idea that sharing information and metrics through computer systems would lead to breakthroughs in efficiency productivity and competitive advantage. More importantly to the founders the company was also created to build what they called the â€œultimate organizationâ€ where creativity and innovation would flourish and people could be their best. Flat decision-making structures where staff were informed and autonomous and had the authority to make decisions would allow solutions and innovations to emerge from anywhere in the organization. The idea of this ultimate organization became a foundation for the evolution of the iQmetrix culture. As a young entrepreneur starting out Christopher Krywulak did not know what the ultimate organization looked like but he did know that he was dissatisfied with what he saw around him in the business world and that he wanted to instead create an organization where people like him could flourish. He believed he would recognize the ultimate organization only after he had created it. This belief turned into the development strategy that iQmetrix returned to time after time. Each time growth put stress on the company the companyâ€™s strategy was to decide what it needed to do next to continue creating the ultimate organization. As the company grew from its Regina base and opened satellite offices in Winnipeg; Vancouver; and Charlotte North Carolinaâ€”eventually employing over 400 peopleâ€”it experienced pressure to become more formalized. Searching for a model that resonated and stayed true to the initial founding vision of the ultimate organization iQmetrix adopted holacracy in early 2017.HolacracyHolacracy contrasted starkly with traditional organizational designs. The goal of holacracy was to create an organization based on simple rules for recognizing articulating and creating the tasks that needed to be accomplished and then giving people the authority to adapt their professional roles to these new tasks at their own discretion. Holacracy organized people around common outcomes or projects. In holacracy there were no job titlesâ€”only roles. Moreover there were no managers in a holacracy. Instead authority was distributed throughout the organization and work was organized by circles that formed and disbanded as required according to the tasks they needed to accomplish. Circles followed detailed procedures regarding how decisions were made and how meetings were run. Holacracy sought to increase transparency and reduce the time required to make decisions by making three key changes to the organization: (1) it organized the work to be done by roles (2) it associated specific accountabilities to those roles and (3) it gave the person assuming each role complete authority to make the decisions required for that role. This contrasted with traditional hierarchies in which the organizational structure tended to push accountability upward and required people who did the work to continually seek authority to make decisions. This resulted in lost time a lack of ownership and low levels of accountability regarding decisions. Such a systemâ€”where the more powerful enjoyed the perks of power and the less powerful had little or no accountabilityâ€”could encourage bad habits for both managers and employees. To successfully implement holacracy iQmetrix would have to avoid both of these outcomes. Over the course of the first year holacracy was rolled out to the entire organization and people became familiar with their roles circles and accountabilities. The companyâ€™s founder and chief executive officer Chris Krywulak anticipated that holacracy would empower individuals to plan monitor and regulate their own work tasks and that leadership would be distributed broadly throughout the organization. Now one and half years later Taplow set out to see whether these expectations had been met. She was especially interested in whether employees perceived holacracy to have improved the company; whether they were happier and more engaged; and whether they were receiving more accurate useful and motivating feedback about their efforts on the job.Taplow had sent the survey to employees in April 2018 and she was pleased to have received a 67 per cent response rate. Now she was excited to have a look at the data. What would employees be saying about their experiences at iQmetrix working under holacracy? Taplow opened the Excel file to see (see Ivey product 7B19C030)."

Our goal is to publish materials of the highest quality; submit any errata to publishcases@ivey.ca. i1v2e5y5pubsCopyright Â© 2019 Management Development Institute Gurgaon and Ivey School of Business Foundation	Version: 2019-03-14The Catholic Syrian Bank Limited (CSB) a regional player in the Indian commercial banking industry was urgently looking to raise capital. It was December 2017 and the recently declared half yearly results of fiscal year (FY) 2017/18 were not encouraging. The bankâ€™s chairman T. S. Anantharaman had said a couple of months earlier that the bank needed a capital infusion of â‚¹4â€“6 billion by December 2017 through private placement. The bank would then aim for an initial public offering (IPO) about three years later once the bank had achieved consistent profitability.Less than a year earlier Canadaâ€™s Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited (Fairfax) had evinced interest in a stake in the CSB. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) the Indian regulator of banks had given its approval but by June 2017 talks between the parties had fallen through on valuation issues. The business media carried contradicting reports on the offer made by Fairfax. Reports ranged from an equity valuation of â‚¹60 to â‚¹100 per share and from an equity valuation of â‚¹10 billion for the bank to â‚¹10 billion for a 51 per cent stake in the bank. In any case the offer was deemed inadequate and was rejected by the CSB board and shareholders. Subsequently at the behest of the RBI the CSB made a counter-offer to Fairfax with a view to resolve the stalemate over valuation. The counter-offer was for a 51 per cent stake in the bank valuing the CSB at â‚¹160 per share (translating to an equity valuation of nearly â‚¹13 billion) plus a control premium. The richer valuation came on the back of an improved set of annual results for the year ended March 31 2017 (see Exhibits 1 and 2 or the student spreadsheet that accompanies this case Ivey product no. 7B19N005). What had changed in a mere six months to warrant the CSBâ€™s ambitious proposal? Should Fairfax accept the offer?the CATHOLIC SYRIAN BANK LimitedThe CSB was established in 1920 in the Thrissur district in the southern state of Kerala India to serve the regionâ€™s Roman Catholic community. The bank maintained its position among the many banks and credit institutions that proliferated and collapsed over the next half century. The CSB played an active part in the consolidation that followed and grew by taking over five such failing banks in Kerala.In 1969 the CSB was included in the RBIâ€™s list of scheduled commercial banks and in 1975 when the bankâ€™s deposits exceeded â‚¹250 million (US$3.73 million) the CSB was granted the status of an A-class scheduled commercial bank. Largely confining its operations to the state of Kerala the CSBâ€™s clientele was predominantly the small businesses and individuals with small accounts. This was reflected in the bankâ€™s geographical distribution: at the end of 2017 approximately 80 per cent of the CSBâ€™s branches were located in rural and semi-urban areas. Still the CSB boasted a strong deposit book because most of its non-resident customers and expatriates in the Persian Gulf region sent money home through the bankâ€™s network. Over the years the bank grew its offerings in personal banking and insurance and in corporate banking which included working capital finance cash management and corporate lending among other services. As of March 31 2017 the CSB had a deposit base of more than â‚¹149 billion and a loan book of over â‚¹81Â billion. Foreign entities including institutions corporate bodies and individuals held more than 30 per cent of the bank (see Exhibit 3).FAIRFAX Financial HOldings LImitedFairfax described itself as a â€œholding company whose corporate objective is to achieve a high rate of return on invested capital and build long-term shareholder value.â€ Through its subsidiaries the firm engaged in property and casualty insurance and investment management.Fairfax was founded in 1985 in Toronto Canada by Prem Watsa who was chairman and chief executive officer at the time of negotiations with the CSB. Fairfax had grown its revenues from US$12.2 million in 1985 its first year of operations to US$9.3 billion in 2016â€”a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of close to 24 per cent of its book value. Fairfaxâ€™s book value per share and closing share price had also recorded impressive CAGRs with the CAGR for book value per share at 19.4 per cent and for closing share price at 18.6 per cent over the same period.As of December 31 2016 Fairfax had invested over US$1.2 billion in India through Fairfaxâ€™s subsidiary Fairfax India.THE BANKING LANDSCAPE IN INDIAAt the end of March 2017 India had 27 government-owned banks 21 private sector banks and 45 foreign banks operating under commercial banking licences in the country. The government-owned banks accounted for close to 70 per cent of the banking sectorâ€™s total book value of assets on March 31 2017 and the private sector banks accounted for a little over 25 per cent. However the situation was the reverse with market capitalization.The private sector group of banks in India consisted of two distinct subgroups: the old private sector banks (OPSBs) and the new private sector banks (NPSBs). The OPSBs primarily originated in a community or region and were formed to serve the needs of members and businesses of that community or region. These banks came into existence in the early to mid-twentieth century. The CSB was one of these OPSBs. The NPSBs were promoted by professionals financial institutions and other commercial organizations when in 1994 the RBI issued new licences for the first time for private sector banks. The idea was to bring a competitive spirit and efficiency to the banking sector. Among other features these banks would be spread geographically leverage technology in their operations adhere to prudential norms from the start and have greater autonomy in recruitment and remuneration.Clearly the NPSBs were different from the OPSBs right from their vision and mission to the way they conducted the business of banking. While OPSBs were defined by their need to serve a circumscribed concentrated clientele the NPSBs were more universal in scale scope and diversity. Among private sector banks the OPSBs accounted for about 16 per cent of the total assets. While their small size and regional focus helped them manage credit risk better due to familiarity and greater control of local information their size and focus also led to lesser diversification and economies of scale. The difference in equity beta between the OPSBs (1.29) and NPSBs (1.15) perhaps reflected these conflicting considerations.FY 2015/16 was a turning point in the business trajectory of Indian banks. The RBI denounced the banks for not having provisioned sufficiently for bad loans and in many cases for converting these bad loans to renewed loans or lines of credit to avoid declaring them as non-performing assets (NPA). Over the next two years NPA were stripped of their disguises increasing the gross NPA ratioâ€”the gross amount of loans recognized as NPA divided by the total loans outstandingâ€”to 9.32 per cent for the Indian banking system by March 31 2017.The bulk of the NPA belonged to government-owned banks (also known as public sector banks) because their advances were largely directed toward large corporate and infrastructure borrowings. To a significant extent the NPA problem was caused by the global commodity market meltdown in the early part of the decade. The majority of the Indian firms that were affected and defaulted on their repayments were from the metals and mining industry. The OPSBs remained relatively insulated from this crisis however because they focused on small and medium sector firms and community-based and geographically concentrated lending.Over those two years the RBI announced many restructuring packages for distressed borrowers to help them manage their debt and avoid insolvency while minimizing losses for the lending banks. These measures finally culminated in the introduction of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 (amended in 2017) under which lenders could take defaulting companies to the National Company Law Tribunal for restructuring. Companies were granted a fixed period of time for resolution failing which the company would be forced into liquidation.In May 2016 in the midst of the NPA crisis the RBI made a radical shift in its policy on ownership of foreign entities in private sector banks. With other limits the change allowed non-promoter foreign entities to acquire more than a 40 per cent stake in Indian banks with RBI approval granted on a case by case basis. All approval for ownership came with the rider that irrespective of shareholding the voting rights of these foreign entities would be capped at 15 per cent. Within one month in June 2016 Fairfax first showed its interest in taking an equity stake in the CSB albeit a minority interest.FAIRFAXâ€™S INTEREST IN the CSBHaving launched an India-dedicated investment company in 2014 Watsa known as â€œCanadaâ€™s Warren Buffetâ€ had already pumped over a billion dollars into India. In November 2016 Fairfax made an offer for a 51 per cent stake in the CSB. This was Watsaâ€™s boldest bet in the country thus far. The CSBâ€™s management was enthusiastic about the prospect of Fairfaxâ€™s fund infusion and applied to the RBI for approval.The outgoing chairman of the CSB announced that the funds would be a primary infusion into the bank rather than a sale of a secondary stake. The funds would be used for growth with a focus on the small and medium enterprises gold and retail. Corporate lending was not an area of significant interest. The chairman added that the bank would appoint an independent evaluator for valuation once the RBI approved the transaction.The CSB had been scouting for funds since 2015 when it had plans to raise â‚¹4 billion through an IPO. However it had deferred that plan due to volatile market conditions and raised approximately â‚¹1 billion through a privately placed equity issue in September 2016 instead. The deal with Fairfax would help augment these funds and enable the CSB to implement its growth plans.However by the middle of 2017 the anticipated deal with Fairfax had fallen through the parties citing differences in valuation. Fairfax attributed its lower valuation of the CSB to the bankâ€™s poor asset quality evidenced by a steady increase in the gross NPA ratio (see Exhibit 4). The CSB on the other hand set its higher valuation betting on a turnaround under the guardianship of the newly appointed managing director C. V. R. Rajendran. The bank was also buoyed by its 2017 year-end performance: it had successfully converted losses at the operating and net levels from the previous year to profits in FY 2016/17. The bankâ€™s chairman asserted that the bank was doing everything it could to strengthen its financial position. This included strengthening its delivery channels leveraging technology and reducing the cost of funds by focusing on lower-cost demand deposits (current account savings accounts popularly termed CASAs) in addition to increasing capital adequacy by raising capital from multiple sources. The results showed in the lower cost of funds and lower cost-to-income ratio for FY 2016/17 although the results for the half-year ended September 30 2017 showed a slight increase in the cost-to-income ratio (see Exhibit 4). Going forward management was aiming to improve profitability at the operating level without the benefit of treasury gains; the goal was to close FY 2017/18 with net profits higher than in the previous year. Ten-year government yields had been declining since April 2014 reaching a low of 6.24 per cent in December 2016 then slowly increasing likely in tandem with increasing interest rates in the U.S. market. By September 2017 the yields had reached 6.66 per cent. Treasury profits were going to be difficult to achieve with interest rates on the rise.The bank needed capital for growth. With the Fairfax deal gone the bankâ€™s board of directors approved a proposal to raise â‚¹4Â billion by issuing a qualified institutional placement (QIP) before the end of 2017 to fund the bankâ€™s growth for the next 18 months. The managing director set a target of 27 per cent growth in advances during FY 2017/18. The market was ripe for the QIP with more than 18 such issues already floated during the year mostly by financial services companies including banks. The CSBâ€™s managing director declared that the bank would defer an IPO until it saw at least three consecutive years of profitability.As if on cue more than 20 investors including private equity investors such as AION Capital Partners Limited the Everstone Group and InCred Finance and distressed asset investors like SSG Capital Management Limited showed interest in acquiring a stake in the CSB although just a minority interest. The bankâ€™s management decided to seek RBI approval only once the parties agreed on valuations.In the meantime there were reports that the CSBâ€™s shares were trading on the grey market at a premium of approximately 25 per cent ostensibly in response to the increased interest from prospective bidders. This spike in share prices was expected to affect the deal prices that would be negotiated and possibly sealed. Speculation was rife that a large transaction would happen at a discount although at a price significantly higher than the spurned offer from Fairfax. An investment by Vallabh Bhansali chairman of ENAM Group gave some indication of what to expect with the bankâ€™s valuation. Bhansali picked up a 4 per cent stake in the bank on May 23 2017 at â‚¹160 per share. The price was a 30 per cent premium on CSBâ€™s per share book value of â‚¹123.5 at the end of March 2017. Bhansaliâ€™s investment was at a lower price-to-book value ratio than the average ratio at which OPSBs had been trading since April 2017; however the high variance in the trading multiples across individual banks made it difficult to simply apply the group average to any individual bank (see Exhibit 5).STRATEGIZING FOR THE FUTUREThe CSBâ€™s results for the six months ending September 30 2017 showed improvements in operating profits despite high employee costs; the improvements were without the support of treasury profits which accounted for only â‚¹20 million as against â‚¹1959 million for FY 2016/17 (indicated as net profit [loss] on sale of investments in Exhibit 1). However the market was disconcerted by the large net loss posted by the bank for the half-year period. The small net profit of â‚¹16 million posted for FY 2016/17 had seemed like the bank was finally recovering.The managing director attributed the financial decline to three main problems: high employee costs high provisioning for bad assets and a low creditâ€“deposit ratio resulting in a negative carry for the bank. Management planned to reduce the average cost per employee by making fresh lateral recruitments and moving toward a performance-based pay system. A focus on recoveries and stemming bad loans seemed to be meeting with success; the bank had recovered â‚¹1.4 billion in bad loans in just the first half of FY 2017/18â€”more than the recoveries made in the whole of FY 2016/17. The low creditâ€“deposit ratio meant more than â‚¹25 billion was invested in low-margin short-term treasury assets. Management aimed to move a sizable portion of these funds into highly rated corporate lending while keeping an eye on capital requirements. The bank was going to remain focused on small and medium businesses rather than on large corporations for lending and it was working on making its credit appraisal and rating systems more robust. These plans were expected to reflect in the bankâ€™s vital parameters over the next three to five years (see Exhibit 6).The bank had ambitious growth aspirations and needed funds to execute them. There were enough investors in the market looking to invest in the bank for at least a minority stake and the CSBâ€™s counter-offer to Fairfax was still on the table. Fairfax had had a successful run with investments in India so far and believed the CSB was a good candidate for investment.

Our goal is to publish materials of the highest quality; submit any errata to publishcases@ivey.ca. i1v2e5y5pubsCopyright Â© 2019 Ivey Business School Foundation	Version: 2019-05-23Chris Barr general manager of the Banff Aspen Lodge (the Aspen) digested the latest news from his management teamâ€™s daily stand-up meeting and thumbed through a stack of applications. It was July of 2018 and the managers had reported on the staff vacancies especially at the Front Desk. The hotel regularly lost staff because of the transient nature of employment in the accommodation industry. Consequently the Aspen faced the never-ending cycle of recruiting and hiring individuals who would place as much emphasis on excellent customer service as did the management team. It would be imperative to have the vacancies filled with the right candidates before the ski season began in Novemberâ€”especially given the tight labour market. The question now before Barr was which candidates should be interviewed within the following week to fill two vacancies at the Front Desk.Barr was confident that the Aspen had many good human resource management practices. However he also wondered whether a more systematic long-term approach to human resource planning recruitment and selection would be possible in such a transient labour market. Therefore Barr thought it was time to also review the Aspenâ€™s overall approach to human resource management.STAFFING THE ACCOMMODATION INDUSTRYThe Canadian EnvironmentThe Canadian accommodation industry had grown moderately since 2010 with increases in revenue ranging from 7.8 per cent in 2010 to 4.2 per cent in 2017. In 2017 Canadian hotels reached 65.9 per cent occupancy the highest occupancy rates since 1999. At the same time as demand was increasing in the industry the unemployment rates in Canada had dropped from a high of 8.1 per cent in 2010 to 6.3 per cent in 2017. Canadaâ€™s overall job vacancy rate (i.e. the number of vacant positions as a percentage of total labour demand based on three-month moving averages) increased from 2.7 per cent in 2015 (when the average hourly wage was $19.15) to 2.9 per cent in 2017 (when the average hourly wage was $20.10). With the unemployment rate declining and the job vacancy rate rising the labour market became tighter. Young Canadians who wanted to travel and see Canada but who could not afford to do so without working along the way were often able to find jobs in the accommodation and food-service industries. Yet most organizations in the industry were unable to fill all the job vacancies through this method.Key success factors for the accommodation industry included having access to a multi-skilled and flexible workforce being part of a franchised chain and word-of-mouth recommendations. It was important to monitor online travel sites such as TripAdvisor Kayak and Trivago and to move quickly to respond to negative feedback because customers were likely to read the comments posted by other users. It was even more important to ensure that staff provided a high level of customer service to minimize complaints in the first place.The Alberta EnvironmentAlbertaâ€™s tourism industry benefited most from US visitors. However in 2015 in addition to Americans Alberta had visitors from the United Kingdom (151600) Germany (117100) Australia (92300) China (85300) Japan (60100) the Netherlands (44500) and other Asian (53400) and European (53300) countries. The fact that visitors came from such a variety of countries highlighted the need for a multi-skilled flexible and multilingual workforce.The Alberta hospitality sector faced significant growth from tourism. In 2017â€“18 visitors to Banff National Park and Jasper National Park grew by 3.0 per cent over the previous year. Employment in the accommodation and food sectors increased by 2.6 per cent from 144400 in 2016 to 148100 in 2017. Over the same time period Albertaâ€™s average resort occupancy rate grew by 0.2 per cent to 63.9 per cent. Albertaâ€™s job vacancy rate in October 2017 was 2.0 per cent which accounted for 12.6 per cent of all job vacancies in Canada. The accommodation and food service sector in the national park regions had vacancy rates higher than the provincial average at 3.7 per cent. The provinceâ€™s October 2017 unemployment-to-job-vacancies ratio was 4.8 unemployed individuals for every job vacancy the fourth highest in Canada. The October 2017 job vacancy rate in Albertaâ€™s Banff-Jasper-Rocky Mountain House region matched that of the accommodation and food-service sector at 3.7 per cent. In that same month Albertaâ€™s average offered hourly wage was $22.75. By January 2018 the job vacancy rate had increased to 3.8 per cent but the average offered hourly wage dropped to $21.85.The Banff Aspen LodgeThe Banff Aspen Lodge was a three-storey 89-unit hotel one of 17 hotels located along a five-block section of Banff Avenue the main street of the town of Banff. The Canadian Hotel Guide ranked the Aspen sixth in Banff with an average guest rating of 8.2 out of 10. In an era of consolidation within the hospitality industry the Aspen was one of the few remaining privately owned properties in Banff. Barr general manager of the hotel aimed to position the property as Banffâ€™s number-one mid-scale property. The Aspenâ€™s primary target markets included the United States Calgary and Edmonton. It attracted many repeat customers because of the relationships the staff had built with guests. Barr focused on an exceptional guest experience as being the key to success. He created a culture of friendly and innovative customer service by empowering staff to create that experience. For example when repeat guests checked into the hotel they would find a personalized note in their rooms welcoming them back to the Aspen. If they had requested an extra blanket on a previous stay the blanket would be already waiting on the bed when they arrived. If a guest had mentioned to housekeeping staff that they preferred dark roast coffee the dark coffee pods were ready and waiting by the coffee maker.The Front Desk staff were the first point of contact for guests arriving from a variety of domestic and international locations. Their job was to make guests feel welcome and to attend to their needsâ€”no matter the hour and regardless of whether guests were travelling alone in families or as part of a tour group. Both check-in and check-out were handled quickly and courteously. Check-out began as early as 5:00 or 6:00 a.m. peaking between 10:00 and 11:00 a.m. after guests had enjoyed one last breakfast buffet. Check-in began mid-afternoon and ran through the late evening. Both processes involved assisting guests with payments by accepting multiple forms of payment and ensuring accurate completion of the task. At the Aspen check-in also required handing out the appropriate number of breakfast vouchers.  The Front Desk might receive calls at any hour of the day or night with guests requesting extra blankets or encountering trouble with the operation of appliances. Wherever possible Front Desk staff tried to ensure that repeat guests could stay in their favourite rooms. If that was not possible upon arrival they arranged for the guests to be relocated the next day. They provided directions and helpful suggestions about activities in the area. If guests were late returning from a long day of sightseeing only a phone call was needed for the garage to be left open past 11:00 p.m. when the underground parking garage was normally locked. The Front Desk staff also performed general office duties and worked to facilitate interdepartmental communication and co-operation in the interest of better guest satisfaction.The Front Desk agents were the first point of contact for prospective patrons providing courteous and efficient telephone service including answering inquiries regarding rates special packages and general information accurately and in a timely manner. They created reservations via telephone written correspondence and in person. It was also the responsibility of Front Desk staff to ensure the safety and well-being of guests and co-workers by being knowledgeable about crisis and emergency procedures. Should there be any kind of emergency in the property the Front Desk was the first place that guests and staff alike would call.The Aspenâ€™s Human Resource Management PhilosophyBarrâ€™s unswerving focus on achieving the hotelâ€™s mission (to provide every guest with an exceptional experience) and vision (being a leader in the hospitality industry) shaped his perspective on managing the people in his organization. Barr believed that hiring the right people coaching and mentoring for success and letting employees do their jobs resulted in both the excellent corporate culture for which the hotel was known and strong word-of-mouth marketing to the family and friends of the hotelâ€™s guests. He had built on the good culture that already existed when he arrived. He worked to bring people out of their comfort zones so they would feel more confident making decisions that would provide the exceptional service to enhance their guestsâ€™ stay. He had an open-door policy and fully supported management and staff decisions with coaching as needed.Barr found it gratifying to know that the staff loved working at the Aspen. Some of the breakfast room employees had been with the Aspen for years and spoke a variety of languages including Japanese and Korean. While their staff turnover rate was below industry standards turnover nevertheless existed because of the transient nature of the industry. In fact Barr identified attracting and retaining staff as being one of the Aspenâ€™s key challenges.The Aspenâ€™s Recruiting ProcessEach morning at 10:30 Barr held a stand-up meeting with his department managers. As needed that meeting dealt with talent management. The hotel was small enough for the managers to know the staff in their departments and to be aware of when contracts and work visas for foreign nationals were coming to an end and therefore when it would be necessary to recruit new staff.The 2016 census indicated that the population of the Town of Banff was only 7851 so employers had a very small talent pool available locally. As well the residents of Banff were well educated. In 2016 73 per cent of the 4125 adults between the ages of 25 and 64 in Banff had completed some form of post-secondary education compared with 64 per cent at the provincial level. Because of the small population of the town the Aspen similar to most Banff hotels relied heavily on recruiting employees from beyond the town and the province. The Aspen recruited through a variety of channels including word of mouth via existing employees the hotelâ€™s website and the Canadian governmentâ€™s Job Bank. Full-time employees often recommended prospective employees. For example Sam Hong manager of the breakfast room was aware of students who were visiting Canada and who attended his church while visiting Banff; if they were able to acquire the appropriate visas they were encouraged to apply. Other employees had friends and neighbours working at various resorts in the town. Because of its reputation as an employer of choice the Aspenâ€™s employees sometimes referred these individuals to Barr and to the other managers including Anthony Formela the Front Desk manager.The â€œCareersâ€ page of the Aspenâ€™s website listed reasons why people would want to work at the Aspen. The Aspen had won the Alberta Hotel and Lodging Associationâ€™s â€œEmployer of Choiceâ€ award four years in a row. It also offered competitive wages employee housing opportunities for further advancement and education a winter incentive a summer canoe pass and a loyalty bonus after one year. The Aspenâ€™s location close to all Banffâ€™s amenities was also a draw. The Amazing Race for the Banff Aspen Lodge was a favourite event that helped to create lifelong friendships among co-workers. Monthly staff events and lunch-and-learn programs helped employees who were new to the country adjust to the culture and supported young adults who were on their own for the first time. The events included such popular activities as hikes to the Tea House at Lake Louise paintball and curling. On a rotating basis the various departments hosted Lunch/Learn/Live events that covered such topics as cooking for yourself what to do if confronted by a bear and where the locals shopped (which was cheaper than the tourist-oriented stores). For some of the younger staff who had never been away from home before speakers from Banff Life offered discussions on such issues as sexually transmitted infections harassment and abuse.Recruitment through the Canadian governmentâ€™s job bank came from three primary sources. Canadians (particularly young people) from Eastern and Central Canada who were eager to move to Western Canada and in particular to the Canadian Rockies regularly sought employment in the hospitality sector. Canada had exchange programs with several countries including Korea New Zealand and the United Kingdom; individuals who wanted to visit Canada for an extended period of time would often apply for positions through these exchange programs. The Working Holiday program was one of three International Experience Canada (IEC) programs. Its applicants who were between 18 and 35 years old came from more than 30 different countries. As such they had different academic cultural and industry backgrounds with varying levels of experience. Some were fresh out of post-secondary education and desired to travel before settling into careers. Others had already capitalized on the program to visit several provinces and they applied to the Aspen with some experience in the hospitality sector. The Aspenâ€™s Hiring ProcessThe department managers reviewed the job applications and completed the preliminary interviews. The most important quality that the Aspen looked for in prospective employees was attitude. Barr would often sit in on the second interview to assess how comfortable the applicants were in the interview and to assess their fit with the Aspenâ€™s culture of providing exceptional customer service. He said the applicantâ€™s cultural fit became apparent during the first 10 minutes of an interview. He used a structured interview approach that included presenting realistic job scenarios. Questions included how applicants would handle difficult situations such as the following: having to plunge a clogged toilet dealing with guests who complained about air quality and called in the health department and responding to guests who were asking for a refund because they were dissatisfied with the room. Barr looked for creativity in handling such situations especially when no manager was available to whom the situation could be escalated.Onboarding and Training at the AspenTo further ensure that guests were provided with an exceptional experience through outstanding service the Aspen devoted significant time to onboardingâ€”having new employees shadow veterans for several days before working on their own. Training began with Barr conducting a staff orientation. New employees learned about the general history of the hotel its mission and vision its organizational structure the hotelâ€™s expectations of employees and what the employees could expect in return from the hotel. Each department also had its own training with checklists of topics to be covered. Department managers wanted to ensure that their staff were well trained and loved working at the Aspen. The result was employees who cared deeply about providing each guest with an exceptional experience.Compensation at the AspenThe Aspenâ€™s compensation plan was above the industry average in Banff which was a significant attractor to prospective employees. Employees also received a $1800 bonus after one yearâ€™s employment in an effort to retain employees longer than the term for employees hired under the Working Holiday program. In addition to attractive rates and bonuses the Aspen offered the best employee accommodation in Banff: four townhouse condos had recently been built across the main street from the hotel property. Two employees shared each bedroom in the townhouse.The DecisionBarr looked at his desk and the pile of applications that Formela had given to him at that morningâ€™s management team meeting (see Exhibit 1). He needed to decide which applicants to interview in the following week and what questions to ask at the interview. Barrâ€™s goal was to extend job offers to the successful applicants in plenty of time for them to make the necessary arrangements to relocate (including obtaining visas where appropriate) before the ski season began in just a few months. Given that Barr viewed recruiting and retaining staff as one of the Aspenâ€™s key challenges he was also eager to identify strengths and areas for improvement in the Aspenâ€™s current approach to human resource management.Exhibit 1: Employment applications received by banff aspen lodge Lhamo SangyamEdmonton ABlhamotsangyam@gmail.com5552129595Profile:-loyal and friendly caring and thoughtful personcurious always eager to develop new skillspunctual personKey Skills:-Patient hardworking energetic and communication skills.Helpful good at interact with other person.Respectful and friendly manner to maintain cooperation with teamwork.Self-motivated and honest person.Successfully scheduled and managed multiple activities.Microsoft office Excel power pointKey compete:Attention to detailCustomer focusListening skillsTeam workHonesty reliabilityHigh energy levelsPlanning and organizing Work experience Chef at pizza pizzaKnowledge of cleaning sensitive materials.Ability to lift push and pull required load.Knowledge of at stampede.5 years experience farmer Hotel Reception in IndiaShellEducation  :-Graduated in India (2014)Languages :-Tibetan English Hindi Reference  :KARMA.

It had taken years for both old and new competitors to build and enhance their business approach to effectively compete with Zaraâ€™s model while online shopping for fashion apparel was on the rise. Many recalled the early deference people had had towards Zara and its counter-intuitive business model. Why would anyone invest in a fashion manufacturer and retailer that produced its clothing in the high-cost labour market of Spain (versus Asia); spent very little on advertising; ostensibly overspent on positioning high-end stores in chic retail districts across Europe; carried substantially less inventory than its competitors; manufactured clothes that were arguably of a lesser quality; and finally charged 15 per cent less at the cash register? By all accounts this approach was viewed as a formula for disaster in the highly competitive retail fashion industry.During those early years most observers were just not forward thinking enough to see the value in Zaraâ€™s approachâ€”and over time Inditex took great pride in proving them wrong. By 2014 Zara was by far the number-one fashion retailer in the world by many measures and it continued to maintain this leadership position in 2019. Its unique business model had enabled this astounding success. Inditex however could not dwell on past successes as the future was full of significant challenges associated with the many new upstart and copycat competitors that had infiltrated the market. It was highly likely that these new firms would also enjoy a reasonable degree of success. Disruptive innovations such as Zaraâ€™s business model inevitably were copied. Examples of companiesâ€™ disruptive business models leading to significant change in their industries included Southwest Airlines Co. leading the discount airline industry Walmart Inc. dominating the discount department store industry and perhaps Googleâ€™s leadership in its Waymo self-driving technology ride sharing services.Perhaps it was time for Inditex to reinvent the industry business model once again.The Early YearsIn 1963 when Amancio Ortega Gaona started his small dressmaking firm in La CoruÃ±a Spain at the tender age of 16 he never dreamed it would lead to the worldâ€™s largest retail fashion empire. Nor did he aspire to become the fourth-richest person in the world. What he did come to understand over the next 12 years was that textile manufacturing was a very risky often frustrating business when you were one step removed from your customers. This was especially true in the fast-changing womenâ€™s fashion segment of the market. So in 1975 when he opened his first Zara store in the centre of La CoruÃ±a a town of 246000 people he was driven by the overriding principle that the key to success as a fashion retailer was to link fashion design to manufacturing and distribution in a way that allowed for rapid responses to the finicky and often changing needs of customers. This was the sole foundation for the creation and growth of Zara and it remained central to its success. This early success spurred the opening of nine new stores in Spainâ€™s largest cities over the next eight years. Ortega also learned that to be successful he would have to take advantage of the intelligence of the employees throughout his company and trust their judgment. In other words a top-down decision-making model as it related to new product design and distribution would be counterproductive to his overriding notion of reacting quickly to customersâ€™ needs. Thus he put decisions related to the critical processes of product design manufacturing and distribution into the hands of his employees across the company.The combined approach of manufacturing new clothing as quickly as possible in response to customersâ€™ needs and desires while adopting a decentralized decision-making process allowed Zara to thrive and grow in the ultra-competitive retail fashion industry. Over the 17 years following the launch of Zara in 1975 Ortega opened more than 1000 new stores culminating in an initial public offering on May 23 2001. The funds raised through this offering provided the fuel for a tremendous evolution that saw Inditex grow to operate 7475 stores in 96 markets across eight brands propelling it to fiscal 2017 revenue of â‚¬25.3 billion and industry-leading gross profit margins of 57.4 per cent (see Exhibit 1). This represented an astounding compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10 per cent over the period 2012â€“2017. Inditex was by far the worldâ€™s largest fashion manufacturing and retail business.the global fashion retail industryThe global retail fashion industry was worth US$2.5 trillion in 2017 employing approximately 75 million people. The industry was expected to grow at a rate of 4â€“5 per cent from 2018 to 2019.The industry was influenced by a number of factors including changing demographics and the urbanization of the global population. A full 60 per cent of the global population would be living in cities by 2025 up from 45 per cent in 2011. Likewise Europe would see 82.2 per cent of its population living in urban centres while in North America this figure was 88.6 per cent. According to a McKinsey & Company report on succeeding in the future fashion market â€œBy 2020 a quarter of global wealth will be concentrated in just 60 mega-cities some of which will be larger than countriesâ€ with 16 of the 20 fastest growing cites for fashion apparel in emerging markets. With the global population predicted to grow to 8.2 billion by 2030 from 7 billion in 2014 it would seem the industry was on a trajectory for continued strong growth. This tied to a growing middle class in developing nations such as China and India could lead to a substantive increase in spending on fashion clothing; in fact China was expected to surpass the United States as the worldâ€™s top fashion retail market in 2019. By 2030 East Asiaâ€™s middle class was expected to number over 3 billion up from the current 1.5 billion. Spending by the middle class was projected to rise from $21 trillion today to $51 trillion in 2030. This would surely fuel the retail fashion apparel industry for years to come (see Exhibit 2).The global womenâ€™s apparel market was predicted to grow by 4.8 per cent annually from 2010 to 2025 outpacing the previous growth of 3.3 per cent for the six years prior. Though as Lu et al. stated â€œSome 80 per cent of top growth cities for total apparel sales by 2025 will be in emerging marketsâ€ leaving growth to lag in developed countries. The authors went on to say that these cities would enlarge the world apparel markets by an additional $100 billion over this period. Emerging markets at that time would represent 55Â per cent of mid-market womenâ€™s apparel sales (see Exhibit 3).The trends and challenges in this market were many. Responsible sourcing including greater visibility across the entire supply chain topped the list. Tragic events such as the blaze at the Tazreen garment factory in Bangladesh in November 2012 had heightened the need for textile manufacturers and retailers to strengthen their supply chains to ensure fair trade safe work environments living wages social commitment and responsible resource development. Industry growth opportunities specifically in developed countries were being led by the plus-size categories. This was a $17.5 billion market in the 12 months ending April 2014 in the United States up 5Â per cent over the previous year and a direct reflection of the obesity epidemic underway in the developed world where seven of 10 Americans were now overweight. The plus-size market opportunity in the United States was estimated at $46 billion. In the United Kingdom the plus-size market was predicted to grow at a CAGR of 7.1 per cent through 2022.Digital adoption by mainstream consumers with online sales of apparel was forecast to grow rapidly outpacing market growth projections. In 2017 McKinsey & Company predicted a 10 per cent CAGR for online apparel and footwear through 2020. In 2017 in the United States alone online sales accounted for 27.4 per cent of overall apparel sales up from 20.7 per cent in 2015 with womenâ€™s apparel trailing but still expected to represent 24 per cent of sales by 2021.  Another factor affecting the industry was global transport costs which were linked to the price of oil. It would seem that with oil prices near or below $60 per barrel since 2014 these costs would likely continue on a downward swing. Technological innovation in textile manufacturing was affecting important metrics within the industry beyond cost reduction. Mass customization small-batch manufacturing and time to market were becoming key risk management factors. These drove a deeper focus across the entire supply chain. In 2017 â€œfast fashionâ€ retailers like Inditex H&M Forever 21 Inc. and Primark Stores Ltd. saw their sales grow by 8.2 per cent in aggregate against an industry growth rate of 3.5 per cent. New fabric innovation was also having a strong positive impact on the growth of the apparel industry specifically in the sportswear market. Commodity prices could significantly impact the industry cost structure specifically the price of cotton which represented 24.5 per cent of the total fibre market in 2016/2017 with production of 23 million metric tons. Global cotton prices hovered around 76 cents per pound and were likely to remain low against a backdrop of demand uncertainty continuing U.S. trade wars and the evolution of synthetics.Additionally the rapidly growing population of consumers over 50 referred to as a â€œdemographic earthquakeâ€ in developed countries would become one of the fastest-growing segments to be considered in terms of its expenditures on clothing. By 2020 spending by this group globally was expected to grow to $15 trillion up from $8 trillion in 2010. Customer behavioursPerhaps the most significant factors driving change in the retail apparel industry were associated with shifting customer behaviours. Customer buying patterns and behaviours could directly influence a firmâ€™s ability to succeed and in many cases determined both a firmâ€™s approach and indeed the resulting industry business model. The urban retail fashion market where Zara played was inextricably tied to two key customer behaviours: Unpredictability and InfluenceFashion apparel customers were a fickle group that could be extremely hard to predict and influence. They could be easily swayed by unpredictable factors such as celebrity fashion friendsâ€™ fashion choices or the need to differentiate themselves in a crowded urban environment. These variables made it extremely challenging to predict the next fashion hit and contributed to the single largest risk in retail apparel: a â€œfashion miss.â€ In turn fashion misses resulted in discounts and markdowns in order to make room for new inventory. For example in its first quarter 2018 report H&M reported $4.3 billion of what Pam Danziger of Unity Marketing called â€œunexciting uninspired unsold inventoryâ€ most of which would have to be discounted. Studies showed that specialty apparel retailers could end up marking down 30â€“40 per cent of their inventory by up to 60 per cent on average. To mitigate this risk many apparel retailers spent an exorbitant amount of money on advertising with a focus on building brand awareness and loyalty. And it workedâ€”to a degree. For example in 2017 Gap Inc. (Gap) spent $673 million on advertising a 12 perÂ cent year-over-year growth representing 4.2 per cent of sales or 10.6 per cent of gross profit margins. In the highly competitive fashion industry this could be the defining driver of profitability. Frequently Changing Tastes Fashion cycles could also be notoriously short especially in the urban womenswear segment. Trends came and went which drove fashion retailers to introduce new fashions more often and avoid replenishing old items where â€œoldâ€ stock could necessitate a potential discount. At H&M speed to sell-out rates ranged from 12 to 38 days in the first three quarters of 2018. On the surface this looked like a strong metric; however H&M tended to replenish sell-out items versus replacing them with new items. In the world of ever-changing consumer tastes replenishment rates should ideally be low reflecting a strong tie to consumersâ€™ needs. This impacted both retailersâ€™ inventory turnover ratios and ability to sell items at or near full price. Introducing new fashions frequently could have the positive desired effect of enticing customers back to the store more often. An average customer would visit the typical fashion store four times per year while some fashion retailers such as Zara enticed their customers back as many as 17 times per year with fresh fashion choices appearing more often. A fashion retailerâ€™s ability to react quickly to shifting fashion preferences could be a defining success factor.Inditex and zaraâ€”A unique approachInditex was the public holding company for Zara and seven other retail brands including Bershka Massimo Dutti Pull&Bear and Stradivarius. After 23 years of diversifying into these new categories Inditex still depended on Zara for the vast majority of its sales and profitability. In 2017 Zara represented â‚¬16.62 billion of Inditexâ€™s revenue across 2251 stores in 96 markets (see Exhibit 4) and a full 70.1 per cent of its earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT). Inditex had been moving rapidly for the last decade. It had taken its sales from â‚¬5.67 billion in 2004 to â‚¬23.34 billion in fiscal 2017. This had been accomplished through a focused geographic expansion effort that had seen the company grow to support 7475 stores by the end of 2017 along with growing online sales in 47 markets. Its recent focus for geographic growth was primarily Asia where it had opened 593 stores in China alone by the end of 2014. The companyâ€™s approach was very different from that of its traditional competitors. For instance it was highly vertically integrated and unlike all of its competitors it manufactured the majority of its own clothing. In fact it manufactured over 60 per cent of its own products in what most would consider high-cost labour marketsâ€”Spain Portugal or other nearby countriesâ€”relying less on third-world and outsourced manufacturing. Its competitors by contrast outsourced the vast majority of their production.Unique CapabilitiesInditex had built a number of defining competencies which its competitors did not possess. The first was associated with time to market. The company could move from a sketch of an idea to a product ready for shipment in as little as 10 to 15 days. This was precisely why Zara had been dubbed the champion of the relatively new â€œfast fashionâ€ industry. However Pablo Isla chief executive officer (CEO) and chairman of Inditex did not endorse this term. â€œI donâ€™t identify with the concept of fast fashionâ€ he said. â€œWe are not about selling a million striped T-shirts as fast as possible.â€ He went on to say that the success was â€œbased not on speed but on accuracy on understanding exactly what customers want week by week and store by store.â€ This highlighted a key capability at Inditexâ€”its ability to identify customer needs and desires and translate these critical inputs back to the design teams in La CoruÃ±a. Zara achieved this through employee groups dubbed â€œcommercials.â€ There were three essential levels of commercials that worked closely with one another at Zara. The design team commercials which typically consisted of four employeesâ€”two product managers and two designersâ€”were responsible for designs in a specific category such as womenâ€™s sport clothing. They were given all the decision authority required to succeed including independence in setting designs ordering fabric determining manufacturing quantities and pricing. These teams decided what Zara would make and sell. In fact they introduced roughly 12000 new individual designs for Zara stores each year. These teams were supported by regional commercials responsible for liaising with store managers (and customers) across certain geographic footprints. Their overriding responsibility was to identify the clothing styles that would sell in their markets. They did this through observing what people were wearing (and importantly wanted to wear) along with the insights (and orders) coming from the store managers. Store managers were the third level of commercials. Their primary responsibility was to select the inventory they believed would sell in their storesâ€”something they accomplished through talking with and observing customers. They had to also be up to the minute and intimate with their store inventory levels and sales. They ordered new inventory within each category in the store twice a week. For many years Zara had chosen to not implement a store-wide inventory management system requiring store managers to count inventory by hand. This among other things forced the store managers to be on the floor and by default to interact with customers. The insights gained from this interaction helped managers purchase inventory for their store that was more relevant and compelling for their customers. However store managers would not always receive the items they ordered. At times the regional commercials would place new items in stores to â€œsee how they would sell.â€ They usually made these new clothes in small batches to avoid any significant markdowns in the event they were not popular. This approach drove Zaraâ€™s industry leading fashion failure rates.Commercials were encouraged to remain vigilant in introducing new items weekly and not restocking old items giving Zara a replenishment rate of only 2.8 per cent. This led to two unique customer behaviours. Firstly Zara customers would visit stores often (17 times per year versus 4.1 for brand loyal shoppers) as there were always new fashions to be had. Secondly when customers found something they liked they were motivated to avoid deferring their decision to purchase as Zara had created a sense of scarcity; it simply would not be there next time. These two behaviours drove Zara to an industry-leading third quarter 2018 trailing 12-month inventory turnover ratio of 28:48.These three levels of commercial teams were the heart of Zaraâ€™s success and they ultimately represented Zaraâ€™s delivery of what customers wanted when they wanted it as CEO Isla had implied. A core capability at Zara related to its ability to efficiently manufacture clothes in small batches. Not only could it move a new item from concept to market very quickly but it was able to accomplish this in small batches permitting it to test the market with very little risk. The challenges of having achieved this level of mass customization should not to be underestimated. Inditex invested heavily in automation within its manufacturing plants and tied this to effective management of its entire supply chain with a focus on breaking down any bottlenecks in the manufacturing process. For instance it operated a local dye and finishing plant close to its factories in La CoruÃ±a and did most of its own pre-cutting prior to delivering product to its sewing subcontractors. This was not without cost implications; its clothes typically cost 20 per cent more to manufacture than its competitorsâ€™ clothes which were manufactured in vast quantities in third-world countries. Distribution was centrally managed through a large distribution centre in La CoruÃ±a. All clothes sold by Zara even those manufactured in Portugal or Morocco (or China for that matter) were sent to Spain for distribution. Bloomberg reported: Beyond the distribution center are the 11 Zara-owned factories. Every shirt sweater and dress made in them is sent directly to the distribution centre via an automated underground monorail. There are 124 miles of track. Across the surrounding Galicia region are subcontractors some of whom have worked for the company since Amancio Ortega founded it in 1975.This enabled Zara to ship new inventory to every store in its network at least twice a week. Orders typically arrived two days after a store placed its request.Additionally Zara looked to manage its production costs by focusing on fabricating apparel that was designed to be worn only a few times driving a lower cost of materials. This did not seem to be an issue with its customers who enjoyed changing their fashions often. MarketingThe foundation of Zaraâ€™s marketing strategy had always been its stores. New stores were opened at a dizzying pace: 0.62 net openings per day over the five years to 2017. The company took store location design and layout very seriously. In fact Zara had â€œa full-time team of architects and visual-merchandising experts whose sole job at Zara HQ [headquarters] is to design and curate every aspect of the store from the sleek decor and light-bulb colour to the music being played and the exact positioning of clothing.â€ Window-front designs were viewed as its pre-eminent form of advertising. In fact Zara had a â€œfull team of window-front designers who constantly travel around to international locations to understand the culture and customers of each store. They then create the window design that is unique to the store and all the props and details are then shipped to each store to be put up under strict guidelines.â€ Zara traditionally had spent lavishly on its store locations. In fact it completely revamped each store every four to five years with minor tweaks in between. Its stores were characterized by a high-end look and feel along with relatively low levels of inventory. This was somewhat anti-intuitive in relation to its competitors who liked to fill their stores with inventory in an attempt to optimize the revenue of their retail space investment. On the contrary Zara had always been focused on making the shopping experience as pleasant as possible for its customers enticing them to come back more often. There were 2238 Zara stores across 96 markets at the end of 2017 driving â‚¬16.6 billion in sales. These stores were primarily situated in the high-end retail sectors of major urban centres. Inditex had recently announced the opening of a 4366 square metre store in the heart of New Yorkâ€™s SoHo district for an astonishing $280 million. Ironically this property was the former home of Old Navy. In March 2016 it had opened a 2800 square metre store in the World Trade Centre in the heart of New Yorkâ€™s financial district. Zara spent very little on advertising only advertising (some) new store openings and twice-yearly sales events. It spent just 0.3 per cent of its revenue on advertising versus the industry standard of 3.5 per cent. There was no advertising line item in its financial reports as this category had not amounted to a material expenditure. Marketing magazineâ€™s assistant editor Belle Kwan discussed Zaraâ€™s approach to advertising:No four-page spread in a glossy publication no gaudy red posters with tacky WordArt bubbles screaming discounts no half-naked B-grade celebrity with perfect hair prancing across a billboard.This is a story about the brand that made it sans advertising sans endorsement and sans almost all forms of mainstream marketing. And when we say â€œmade itâ€ we mean a loyal global following across 78 countries and a name that draws squeals of excitement from consumers and nods of respect from industry experts. Zara typically priced its clothes an average of 15 per cent lower than its competitors. It had been Ortegaâ€™s goal from his humble beginnings in La CoruÃ±a in 1975 to provide good quality fashion clothing at affordable prices. The difference was Zara did not look like any discount fashion store in the marketplace. As Derek Thompson of The Atlantic put it Zara liked to â€œcozy up to the most famous brands in the world to sing their luxury ambitions even as they profit off a brilliant cheap short supply chain that delivers similar fashion at a much lower price.â€ Zara enjoyed placing its stores close to luxury brands such as Prada and Gucci which of course tried to keep as far from Zara as possible. Competing Industry Business ModelHistorically industry titans such as Gap introduced the majority of their new clothing launches twice a year during the spring and fall fashion seasons. These introductions were preceded by up to nine months of centralized planning production and marketing. New line items were revealed to the market on fashion runways and vetted through a team of elite fashion designers and corporate executives. Small runs were made at third-world manufacturers shipped to centralized facilities vetted once more changed and finalized. At this point large orders were placed with these manufacturers for production at ultra-low per-unit cost. Orders were shipped and stored in regional warehouse facilities relatively close to retail outlets. Retail point-of-sale strategies were drawn up and store layouts designed. Inventory levels determined centrally were shipped to stores. Subsequently the advertising and selling began in full force to push product offerings to prospective customers. This approach carried the risk of fashion misses which traditionally were more than offset by the ultra-low costs of manufacturing offshore. This led to industry-standard gross profit margins of approximately 38.3 per cent in 2017. Growth was accomplished through both geographic expansion and brand expansion. For example Gap grew from 1640 stores in 2004 to a peak of 3721 in 2015 and was currently sitting at 3594 stores. Gap also grew across multiple brands representing different market niches including Gap Banana Republic Old Navy Athletica and Intermix. It was not uncommon to have multiple Gap-branded stores in one mall or shopping district. Innovative new fashion CompetitorsAs with any successful business model that changed an industry Zaraâ€™s model inevitably led to the emergence of a host of new competitors who presented either variations of the model or totally new approaches. Zara was experiencing this first hand with the emergence of competitors such as Uniqlo Co. Ltd. (Uniqlo) and Boohoo.com (Boohoo). Uniqlo was a Japanese firm that had been labelled a technology company not a fashion company and it had a sole focus on revolutionary fashion changes through technology innovation around the products not the fashion. Kensuke Suwa Uniqloâ€™s director of global marketing explained its approach:Between fashion and sports is a new area. . . There are a lot of fashion trends going on but there is no true innovation that impacts your actual life. How to make your life better could be in the middle between fashion and sports. For example athletes wear technically sophisticated uniforms; some of the essence of that could result in better clothes that would change clothing itself instead of just following fashion trends.This approach helped Uniqlo quickly grow to 3445 stores as of the end of fiscal 2018 with a sales forecast of $18.2 billion in its 2017 fiscal year. In 2018 Uniqlo was the largest apparel chain in Asia accounting for 6.5 per cent of apparel sales in Japan alone with an eye to becoming number one in the world and a near-term goal of expanding beyond its 50 stores in the United States.Boohoo a U.K. online â€œultra-fast fashionâ€ retailer had seen tremendous growth since its inception in 2006 with 2018 sales of Â£579.8 million and gross margins rivalling those of Zara at 52.8 per cent. With a direct focus on 16â€“30 year olds Boohoo took products from concept to sale in just two weeks putting over 100 new products on its website daily. Boohooâ€™s sales had been growing outside the United Kingdom in both Europe and the United States across a growing number of online brands: Boohoo PrettyLittleThing and NastyGal.  Next StepsThe competitive landscape was changing. The fast fashion world Zara had invented and dominated was changing. Perhaps it was time to reposition how Zara and the other Inditex brands competed in this changing world. Zara had changed the retail fashion industry once.
